			You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat
			requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.
		</p>
		<p>You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.</p>
		<h3>Dark Gifts</h3>
		<p style="margin-top:-12px;">
			Dark Gifts aren't exactly feats, but have more in common with them than anything else. They are intended to provide flavour and role playing opportunities for starting characters in horror-flavoured
			campaigns, particularly ones in the Ravenloft setting. Although they are intended for starting characters, they can be gained later, though they are intended to be offered by the DM like faustian
			bargains or inflicted as curses rather than picked up as feats. See the Other Rules page for elaboration on the process of gaining a Dark Gift.

				<h4>Symbiotic Being</h4>

			</summary>
			<p class="halv">
				A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance,
				either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote's desires, it might
				strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote
				resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight. Roll on or choose an option from the Symbiotic Nature table to determine what sort of symbiotic being shares your body.
				Additionally, you gain the traits that follow:<br>
				<i><b>Entwined Existence:</b></i> Your symbiote is a separate entity with its own physical form bound to yours. It isn't a separate creature and relies on you to survive. It has Intelligence,
				Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote's abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear
				using your senses. The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception,
				History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don't already have it, representing the symbiote's counsel and
				guidance. If you die, so does your symbiote. If you are subsequently returned to life, your symbiote revives as well.<br>
				<i><b>Sustained Symbiosis:</b></i> Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of
				your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and
				regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20. Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote can't use it again until you finish a long rest.<br>
				<i><b>Symbiotic Agenda:</b></i> Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends
				on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don't act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on
				a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote's Charisma modifier) or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by the symbiote for 1d12 hours. While charmed, you must try to follow the
				symbiote's commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Roll or choose from the Symbiotic Agenda table to determine the
				symbiote's goal, working with your DM to detail the specifics or create another agenda.

				After finishing a long rest, you can spend one hour working with your chosen tools to create a special trap using materials harvested or found in the field. These traps can be placed on the ground

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Ensnaring Trap:</i></b> The triggering creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained until it escapes by spending an action to make a strength check
					against your trap save DC.</li>
				<li><b><i>Spiked Trap:</i></b> The triggering creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 piercing damage</li>
				<li><b><i>Sonic Trap:</i></b> The trap makes a sound audible out to 300 feet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Starting at 10th level, you can make the following advanced traps:</p>

					turn.</li>
				<li><b><i>Gas Trap:</i></b> The triggering creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.</li>

				They always return, wait just beyond the reach of deterrents, or later crawl out of your clothes and equipment. Roll on or choose an option from the Watchers table to determine what sorts of forms
				the spirits typically take when they follow you. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow:<br>
				<i><b>Borrowed Eyes:</b></i> As an action, you can influence the presence guiding the watchers for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception)
				checks, and you can't be blinded. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.<br>
				<i><b>Dread Presence:</b></i> You have disadvantage on Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance), and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made against creatures that can see the watchers, and you have 
				disadvantage on saving throws made against the <a href="./spells.html?l=Scrying"><i>Scrying</i></a> spell. You can temporarily disperse or hide the watchers with some effort. With 1 minute of work
				and a successful DC 15 Charisma (Animal Handling) check, you can suppress your Borrowed Eyes and Dread Presence for 1 hour. Once you successfully suppress these features, you can't do so again until
