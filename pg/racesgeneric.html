				<h2>Aasimar</h2>
				<p><i>I saw her, wreathed in wings of pure light, her eyes blazing with the fury of the gods. The bone devils stopped in their tracks, shielding their faces. Her blade, now a brand of light, swept
					once, twice, three times. The devils' heads hit the ground, one after another. And thus we learned that an aasimar traveled in our ragtag band.</i><br><br></p>
					<p class="quotsauc">— Geldon Parl, <i>Of the Tyranny of Dragons</i></p>
				<p>
					Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended
					from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of
					many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods,
					their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly
					visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.
				</p>
				<h4>Celestial Champions</h4>
				<p>
					Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their
					patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause
					of justice. From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from
					celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a
					sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness. Each aasimar can count a
					specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a
					deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.
				</p>
				<h4>Hidden Wanderers</h4>
				<p>
					While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low
					profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and
					other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial
					champion if they had the chance. When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed
					helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They
					nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they
					desire is never worth endangering the innocent.

				<h4>Aasimar Guides</h4>
				<p>
					An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic
					being. That being — usually a deva — provides guidance to the aasimar, though
					this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct
					command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions,
					prophecies, and feelings. The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance
					is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have
					insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about. As part of
					fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's
					angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use
					to flesh out your character's guide.
				</p>
				<h4>Conflicted Souls</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Note to the DM: Playing an Angelic Guide</i></h4>
					<p>
						As DM, you take on the role of an aasimar's angelic guide and decide what
						kind of advice or omens to send in dreams. The deva, or other celestial
						being, is your chance to add special roleplaying opportunities to the game.
						Remember, a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might
						not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple
						with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must
						live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most
					aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a
					curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the
					world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to
					celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing. Evil aasimar make
					deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a
					horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them. Even aasimar
					wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that
					guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and
					help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push
					forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might
					pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but
					not infallible.
				</p>
				<h4>Aasimar Names</h4>
				<p>
					Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming
					conventions as their native culture.

						<b><span class="noindent">Protector</span></b><br>
						Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to

					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent"></span>Scourge</b><br>
						Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within

						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Constitution
						score increases by 1.<br>

						flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other
						creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a
						Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
						modifier) or become <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you until the end of your next turn. Your
						transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action.
						During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to

		<div class="container racecont"> <!-- Bugbear -->
			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Bugbear.PNG">
			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Bugbear</h2>
				<p>Bugbears feature in the nightmare tales of many races - great, hairy beasts that creep through the shadows as quiet as cats. If you walk alone in the woods, a bugbear will reach out of the bushes
					and strangle you. If you stray too far from the house at night, bugbears will scoop you up to devour you in their den. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul stays trapped inside, and the
					bugbears use your head to magically command all whom you once knew. Lurid tales such as these have flowered from the seeds of truth. Bugbears do rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring
					to operate at night. They do take the heads of enemy leaders, but they are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. Bugbears aren't likely to attack lone travelers or
					wandering children unless they clearly have something to gain by doing so. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and
					lethargy.</p>
				<h4>Shiftless, Savage Layabouts</h4>
				<p>When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing. They don't engage in crafting or agriculture to any great extent, or otherwise produce anything of value. They bully
					weaker creatures into doing their bidding, so they can take it easy. When a superior force tries to intimidate bugbears into service, they will try to escape rather than perform the work or
					confront the foe. Even when subsumed into a goblinoid host and drawn into war, bugbears must often be roused from naps and bribed to get them to do their duties. This indolence offers no clue to
					how vicious the creatures are. Bugbears are capable of bouts of incredible ferocity, using their muscular bodies to exact swift and ruthless violence. At their core, bugbears are ambush predators
					accustomed to long periods of inactivity broken by short bursts of murderous energy. Ferocious though they may be, bugbears aren't built for extended periods of exertion.</p>
				<h4>Gang Mentality</h4>
				<p>Since bugbears aren't a particularly fecund race, their overall population is small and spread over a wide area. Bugbears live in family groups that operate much like gangs. The individuals in a
					group typically number fewer than a dozen, consisting of siblings and their mates as well as a handful of offspring and an elder or two. A gang lives in and around a small enclosure, often a
					natural cave or an old bear den, and it might have supplementary dens elsewhere in its territory that it uses temporarily when it goes on long forays for food. In good times, a bugbear gang is
					tight-knit, and its members cooperate well when hunting or bullying other creatures. But when the fortunes of a gang turn sour, the individuals become selfish, and might sabotage one another to
					remove opposition or exile weaker or unpopular members to keep the rest of the gang strong. Fortunately for the race as a whole, even young and elderly bugbears have the ability to survive alone
					in the wild, and the cast-off members of a gang might eventually catch on with a different group. Left to their own devices, bugbears have little more impact on the world than wolf packs. They
					subsist by crafting simple tools and hunting and gathering food, and gangs sometimes come together peacefully to exchange members and goods between them.</p>
				<h4>Malevolent Worship of Malevolent Gods</h4>
				<p>Bugbears worship two deities who are brothers, Hruggek and Grankhul. Hruggek is the fearsome elder sibling, possessed of legendary might and prowess in battle. Bugbears believe their strength and
					bravery come from him. Cunning Grankhul is the younger one, and in the stories bugbears tell, he gifted them with stealth but in return he sapped their vigor, so that bugbears sleep in his stead
					while he remains eternally alert and awake. According to bugbear legends, Hruggek and Grankhul often fight alongside each other, preying upon all they encounter as is their right as superior
					warriors. Hruggek takes the heads of those he kills and puts them on spikes in his den, where they utter pleas for mercy and sing paeans to his might. Grankhul watches over Hruggek when he sleeps,
					but if he must be elsewhere, he whispers commands to the severed heads to wake Hruggek if any danger threatens him. Bugbears admire the qualities of both brothers. Because of Hruggek, they
					consider bravery and physical superiority to be their natural state. Thanks to Grankhul, they can use their size and strength to work as stealthy assassins rather than blundering around like
					ogres. Bullying, murder, and engaging in battle are all holy acts for bugbears. Garroting an unsuspecting creature and defeating foes in open battle are seen as acts of worship, in the same way
					that dwarves consider metalsmithing to be sacred to Moradin. The bugbears recognize two other gods, both of which they disdain and fear: Maglubiyet and Skiggaret. Maglubiyet, the leader of the
					goblinoid pantheon, forced both brothers to submit to his rule, but instead of killing them, he showed mercy and even honored them in a way by setting them free — under his control — so that
					bugbears could continue to employ their talents against his enemies. Bugbears understand that by venerating Hruggek and Grankhul, they also give tribute to Maglubiyet, even though they don't
					openly pay homage to their overlord. When bugbears are called to join a host, bugbears believe Maglubiyet has again corralled the brothers into a divine battle, and they honor their gods by
					following suit. Skiggaret is the bugbear version of the bogeyman, as hateful and terrifying to them as bugbears are in the eyes of many other races. His name is rarely spoken, and never above a
					whisper. Skiggaret's influence manifests at times when bugbears are forced to act in a cowardly fashion; a bugbear that knows or feels itself to be in mortal danger is affected by a form of
					madness and will do anything, including trying to flee, in order to stay alive. Bugbears believe that this feeling of fear comes from being possessed by Skiggaret, and they don't relish
					experiencing it. After the madness has passed, bugbears don't dwell on things that were done in the presence of Skiggaret. Talking about such acts might call him back.</p>
				<p>Goblinoids are indoctrinated from a young age to consider all gods but their own as lesser, false entities. Maglubiyet is the only true deity, they learn, and the world will be wracked by chaos
					and despair until he one day conquers all pantheons. Goblinoids harbor a special hatred for clerics of enemy deities, focusing on them in battle and desecrating their temples whenever they have
					the chance. Whether a deity is good, evil, or neutral is immaterial. All gods other than Maglubiyet and his servants are false and must be destroyed.</p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right; font-size:90%;">
					<h4><i>Bugbear Special Forces</i></h4>
					<p>Under any circumstances, bugbears are valued members of a goblinoid host. If some of them are specialized (or can be trained) in different aspects of warfare, their value increases,
						especially when they work in concert.</p>
					<p><i><b>Thugs.</i></b> Bugbears that serve as thugs have more of Hruggek than Grankhul in them. They leap in among massed foes and make wide, whirling swings with their weapons to create openings in
						enemy formations.</p>
					<p><i><b>Bulwarks.</i></b> The wild attack of a group of thugs is often followed by the charge of one or more bulwarks. A bugbear bulwark carries a spiked shield into battle that it uses like
						a plow, bashing aside whatever it encounters.</p>
					<p><i><b>Murderers.</i></b> Bugbears that are gifted in stealth are sent out to kill enemy sentries and thus clear the way for others to penetrate the foe's defenses. Murderers carry many
						javelins with them, which they throw from hiding and wield in melee, and they also carry garrotes to cut off sounds of screaming.</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Blessings of the Bugbear Gods</h4>
				<p>Bugbears have no use for priests or shamans. No one needs to tell them what their gods want. If the brother gods are angry with them, they let the bugbears know with bolts of lightning (Hruggek) or
					by striking them blind or dead (Grankhul). Bugbears worship their gods simply by preying on other creatures, using no other sort of ceremony to show obeisance - with one exception. In an act of
					worship that also sometimes attracts favorable attention from their gods, bugbears sever the heads of defeated foes, cut away or stitch open the eyelids, and leave the mouths hanging open. The
					heads are then placed on spikes or hung from, cords around a bugbear den. The heads themselves are trophies that honor Hruggek, and their ever-staring eyes are an homage to sleepless Grankhul. The
					heads of leaders and mighty opponents are particularly sacred, and offering up such a trophy can provide a bugbear gang with a special boon. A gang that gains the favor of Hruggek and Grankhul in
					this way might find that the head will emit a shout when an enemy gets too close (in the fashion of an alarm spell). Sometimes the heads of people who have information the bugbears need speak
					their secrets amid blubbered pleas for mercy (as with the speak with dead spell).</p>

		<div class="container racecont"> <!-- Dragonborn -->
			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Dragonborn.PNG">
			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Dragonborn</h2>
				<p><i>Her father stood on the first three stairs that led down from the portal, unmoving. The scales of his face had grown paler around the edges, but Clanless Mehen still looked as if he could
					wrestle down a dire bear himself. His familiar well-worn armor was gone, replaced by violet-tinted scale armor with bright silvery tracings. There was a blazon on his arm as weil, the mark of some
					foreign house. The sword at his back was the same, though, the one he had carried since even before he had found the twins left in swaddling at the gates of Arush Vayem. For all her Life, Farideh
					had known that reading her father's face was a skill she'd been fortunate to team. A human who couldn't spot the shift of her eyes or Havilar's world certainly see only the indifference of a
					dragon in Clanless Mehen's face. But the shift of svales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth — her father's face spoke volumes. But every scale of it, this time,
					seemed completely still — the indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh.</i><br><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— Erin M. Evans, <i>The Adversary</i></p>
				<p>
					Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn
					originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of
					soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
				</p>
				<h4>Proud Dragon Kin</h4>
				<p>
					Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin,
					but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green.
					They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 61/2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each
					hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn dans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red,
					green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.
				</p>
				<h4>Self-Sufficient Clans</h4>
				<p>
					To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the
					honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining
					the bounds of that position. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail,
					and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same
					commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn. Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best
					source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.
				</p>
				<h4>Honor and Family</h4>
				<p>Every aspect of dragonborn life is dictated by the race's code of honor and strict adherence to tradition. Dragonborn society is highly ordered, with each member expected to do one's utmost for
					family and clan. This loyalty and sense of duty sustained the dragonborn during their long history of enslavement and also enabled them to form communities and nations of free dragonborn. In
					dragonborn culture, the family is made up of one's direct relations, while a clan is a collection of families brought together by alliance, intermarriage, or shared history. Although they are
					rarely forced to choose one over the other, the clan's welfare is more important to most dragonborn than the family's. The promise of honor within the clan drives them to acts of heroism daring,
					or excellence, all meant to bring glory to the clan first and the individual second.</p>
				<h4>Philosophy and Religion</h4>
				<p>
					Their code of honorable behavior and unswerving loyalty serves the dragonborn as a kind of faith, and, according to the traditionalists among them, that outlook is all the religion they need.
					Because they were forced to worship their draconic masters in times past, dragonborn are generally skeptical about religion, seeing it as a form of servitude. The skeptics believe that no matter
					how their original god, Io, brought them into being, that ancient deity is either long dead or uncaring about their fate, and the dragon gods that supplanted Io seem primarily interested in
					amassing soldiers for their ages-old conflict. Still, some dragonborn do hear the call of the gods and choose to serve them, and are as loyal in this faith as they are to any other cause. Bahamut
					and Tiamat have dragonborn worshipers, and warrior gods are likely to appeal to a dragonborn's sense of honor, it's warrior spirit, or both. Religious belief is an intensely personal thing to the
					dragonborn who espouse it, some of whom are as devoted to their faith as they are to their family and clan.

			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Dwarf</h2>
				<p><i>"Yer late, elf!" Came the rough edge of a familiar voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend.
					In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf's long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. "Knew I'd find ye in trouble if I
					come out an' looked for ye!"</i><br><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— R. A. Salvatore, <i>The Crystal Shard</i></p>
				<p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to dan and tradition, and a burning
					hatred of goblins and orcs — these common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
				<h4>Short and Stout</h4>
				<p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as
					much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with
					red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often
					have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully</p>
				<h4>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h4>
				<p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world
					of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
					perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>
				<p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their
					ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the
					dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p>
				<p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to
					forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>
				<h4>The Path to Perfection</h4>
				<p>Dwarves have a strong sense of their progress, and each day that goes by must bring them closer to the standard set by their creator Moradin. Acutely aware of their mortality, they see the many
					centuries afforded to them as too short a time to risk wasting even a single day in indolence. Moradin crafted the dwarves' sturdy bodies, giving them the strength to work for long periods of
					time. Rather than imparting his skills to them, he fueled their spirits with a burning desire to follow his example. His gifts of durability and purpose gave the dwarves all they needed to
					devote their lives to steady work, refining their skills and improving their inner selves while they transform rock and ore into wondrous creations.</p>
				<h4>Lifetimes of Glorious Labor</h4>
				<p>Dwarf artisans regard the fruits of their labors with the same love that members of other races reserve for their children. A dwarf's works are built to last for centuries, to carry a legacy into
					the world long after the dwarf is gone. Each item a dwarf crafts is a milepost on the path to perfection, a step taken toward mastering a technique. All of one's works taken together are the
					physical representation of a dwarf's accomplishments. A dwarf who has lived a good, fruitful life leaves behind a rich legacy of wondrous goods- gleaming metal goblets, gem-encrusted stone
					sculptures, tapestries made of ores and minerals, finely honed weapons, or the end result of any other endeavor that enriches the crafter while it pays homage to the Creator.</p>
				<p>Dwarves guard their personal creations with the vigilance and ferocity of a dragon protecting a treasure hoard. Such protectiveness isn't often called for in the company of friends and family —
					but just as a parent doesn't leave a child unattended, a dwarf doesn't craft an item and then knowingly leave it vulnerable to being stolen (or worse). A dwarf who loses an item to thievery
					pursues the item's recovery or seeks vengeance against the thieves with the same fury that parents direct against those who kidnapped their child. At the other extreme, a dwarf's gift of a
					personal item to someone else is a deep expression of commitment, love, and trust. The beneficiary of the gift is expected to provide the item with the same careful stewardship exhibited by its
					creator-never letting it fall into an enemy's hands and sparing no effort to recover it if is stolen.</p>
				<h4>The Greatest Legacy</h4>
				<p>The life of a dwarf is all about doing good work and leaving behind a fitting legacy that continues to bolster the clan even after its creator has passed on-a legacy counted not only in objects,
					but also in dwarven souls. Dwarves who become parents rightfully think of their children as the greatest legacy they can leave the clan, and they raise them with the same care and attention to
					detail that they give to the items they create. A dwarf's direct descendants — beloved sons, daughters, and grandchildren — are often the ones who inherit the inanimate works their ancestor
					leaves behind.</p>
				<p>Marriage is a sacred rite among the dwarves, taken very seriously because it requires two children to move away from their homes to start a new family in the clan. The affected families feel a
					sense of loss that is healed only when a new dwarf child enters the world — an event that calls for great celebration. Few dwarves develop romantic feelings for their spouses, at least not in the
					way that other races do. They view their spouses as collaborators and co-creators, their elders as respected experts to be obeyed, and their children as their most treasured creations. The
					emotion that underlies all those feelings might not be love, as others would term it, but it is just as intense.</p>
				<h4>Minds as Rigid as Stone</h4>
				<p>Although the dwarves' obsessive pursuit of perfection in the arts of crafting leads them to produce great works, it comes at a price. Dwarves value stability, repetition, and tradition above all
					else. Chaos and change cause distractions from the task at hand. Dwarves crave predictability, routine, and safety. A mind not fully focused can't give a task its proper attention. This rigidity
					in outlook, though a fundamental part of the dwarven psyche, can sometimes be a disadvantage. Dwarves don't change their minds easily, and once set on a course rarely alter their strategy. Their
					commitment to following a plan serves them well when they build a stone bridge designed to last for centuries, but the same inflexibility can bring problems when applied to the unpredictable
					dangers of the world. A clan might continue to depend on the same plan for defending its stronghold that has been used for centuries, without considering the possibility that its enemies have
					discovered how to overcome those defenses.</p>
				<h4>Clans and Kingdoms</h4>
				<p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine
					jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings
					frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
				<p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Friendly From a Distance</i></h4>
					<p>
						Even though dwarves have a natural affinity for one another, different clans keep a comfortable distance between their strongholds. Anyone not of the clan, even another dwarf, is considered
						an outsider. They might exchange messengers to share lore and news that can prove useful against the vagaries of the outside world, but that is likely to be the extent of their contact. Under
						normal circumstances, dwarves prefer to be left alone. Interacting with neighbors brings unpredictability and change, things dwarves prefer to avoid.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>The Clan</h4>
				<p>The clan is the basic unit of dwarven society, an extended family that dwells together. Everything a dwarf does in life is devoted to improving or helping the clan, bringing security and stability
					to its members and greater glory to the group. The most important clan members to any dwarf are the members of one's immediate family, because the instinctive connection between parent and child
					is stronger than the attachment between unrelated clan members. Nevertheless, the distinction is so slim as to be unnoticeable to outsiders — dwarves will endure hardship or lay down their lives
					for any of their clan mates, whether related to them by blood or by the devotion that holds the clan together.</p>
				<p>Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be
					clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
				<h4>Roles in the Clan</h4>
				<p>Every clan calls upon its members to fill three principal roles, each of which contributes to the group's welfare.</p>
				<p style="width:69%">First, many dwarves support the clan by working at an occupation that sustains the community — brewing ale, tending crops, and preparing food, for instance. Not everyone can be a master artisan or
					a vigilant warrior; the clan needs a wide range of labor and talents to meet all the needs of the group. </p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Dwarves and Ale</i></h4>
					<p>
						Dwarves have a reputation for being able to consume great quantities of ale. Although drinking plays a significant role in their culture, it is a mistake to assume that intoxication has the
						same effect on them as it does on humans. Humans drink to forget, while dwarves drink to remember. A dwarf deep in his cups is overcome by powerful, vivid memories of his past, especially
						events tied to lost kin, great deeds, or monumental failures. When dwarves drink in a group, this effect spreads among them. The clan might joyfully sing of triumph as they reminisce over the
						defeat of a dragon, or weep as they recall the death of a beloved elder. In contrast to clan gatherings, dwarves who drink alone invariably become morose and sullen — when separated from
						their clan mates, they can't avoid dwelling on unpleasant memories. It's the wise traveler who leaves alone the sole, drunken dwarf in the corner.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Filling the second role are an equally large number of dwarves whose occupations involve the crafting of items and other forms of creation — smelting, smithing, gem-cutting, sculpture, and similar
					tasks. These artisans are responsible for making the items that help the clan protect its stronghold.</p>
				<p>The third function is performed by those who navigate the space between the clan and the chaotic creatures of the outside world. These dwarves are merchants, warriors, and envoys, tasked with
					representing the dwarves in dealings with other races and with providing a buffer between the clan and the potential threats of creatures and communities in the vicinity of the stronghold.</p>
				<h4>Dwarf Names</h4>
				<p>A dwarf's name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf's name belongs to the clan, not to
					the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.</p>
				<h4>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h4>
				<p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure — for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves
					are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might
					seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a
					mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>
				<h4>Dwarven Religion</h4>
				<p>The religion of the dwarves is at the root of the societal roles that dwarves follow. Where most other creatures view their deities as ultra-powerful beings who stand forever apart from their
					worshipers, the dwarves see their gods as exemplars who blaze a path for their lives to follow. Dwarven deities exist in a wide variety, with a few common across many worlds. They are
					collectively known as the Mordinsamman. Moradin is foremost among the dwarven pantheon, the epitome of everything dwarves strive to be. The rest of the group consists of those first dwarves who
					performed their labors so well that they could almost duplicate Moradin's level of skill. The Dwarf Deities table lists the members of the Mordinsamman.</p>

				<details> <!-- Duergar -->
					<summary>
						<h2>Duergar <span style="color:red; font-size:90%;">☠</span></h2>
					</summary>
					<p>The gray dwarves, or duergar, live deep in the Underdark. After delving deeper than any other dwarves, they were enslaved by mind flayers for eons. Although they eventually won their freedom,
						these grim, ashen-skinned dwarves now take slaves of their own and are as tyrannical as their former masters. Physically similar to other dwarves in some ways, duergar are wiry and lean, with
						black eyes and bald heads, with the males growing long, unkempt, gray beards.</p>
					<p>Duergar see themselves as the true manifestation of dwarven ideals, clever enough not to be taken in by the treacherous deceptions of Moradin and his false promises. Their period of
						enslavement and the revolt against the mind flayers led by their god, Laduguer, purged the influence of the other dwarven gods from their souls and thus made them into the superior race.
						Duergar have no appreciation for beauty, that ability having been erased from their minds by the mind flayers long ago and any thought of recapturing it obliterated by Moradin's betrayal. The
						duergar lead bleak, grim lives devoid of happiness or satisfaction, but they see that as their defining strength — the root of duergar pride , as it were — rather than a drawback to be
						corrected.</p>
					<p>Duergar value toil above all else. Showing emotions other than grim determination or wrath is frowned on in their culture, but they can sometimes seem joyful when at work. They have the
						typical dwarven appreciation for order, tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aesthetic or artistic value. Few duergar become
						adventurers, fewer still on the surface world, because they are a hidebound and suspicious race. Those who leave their subterranean cities are usually exiles.</p>
					<p>To impartial observers, the tale of the ancient war between dwarves and duergar is at its heart a tragedy, the story of a people turned against each other by bitterness and resentment. Once
						the dwarves were unified in their worship of Moradin, the deity who crafted the first dwarves from metal and fire. Today, the race is splintered into those who still embrace him as their
						father and creator- and those who have sworn to topple him from his divine throne. While the dwarves loyal to Moradin take joy in the art of crafting and form strong family bonds, the duergar
						are joyless, hateful creatures who create their works out of an urge to build and acquire. They come closest to feeling true joy when they raid dwarven strongholds to satisfy their lust for
						blood and treasure.</p>
					<h4>The Deep Roots of War</h4>
					<p>
						The conflict began in ages past, when the world was new. Almost all the dwarves were more than content to make their homes inside the mountains and hills that were filled with ore and other
						valuables, not digging too far beneath the surface. The dwarves of clan Duergar, however, became obsessed with delving deep into the Underdark. The clan's miners continually insisted that a
						great trove of gold and iron lay just beyond where the clan had explored. The next strike of a pick, they said, could reveal wealth beyond imagining. This obsession took root and spread
						throughout the clan. Soon, all other activity in the community ceased; the forges grew cold, and the temples to Moradin stood empty. Every dwarf old enough to hold a pick or shovel worked the
						mines. The dwarves relentlessly dug, hacked, and tunneled. The weakest among them fell dead from exhaustion, the rest pausing only long enough to push the corpses aside so they could continue
						the digging. Only the hardiest and most iron-willed individuals of the clan survived this brutal campaign. 
					</p>
					<p>
						When their delving finally broke through into a cavern, the dwarves found the cause of their obsession. A great elder brain and its mind flayers waited there, ready to take the next step in
						the subjugation of clan Duergar. The monsters had sent out a psychic lure that played on the dwarves' greed, and the never-ending work schedule that was the product of their obsession weeded
						out all but the best specimens for their slave pens. The illithids had no trouble overwhelming the remaining dwarves with their psionic power and soon put them to work. The dwarves proved to
						be able slaves, but the elder brain saw within them another kind of usefulness. The dwarves' innate ability to resist the effects of harmful substances such as poison made them suitable
						subjects for a variety of grisly experiments. Generations of psychic surgery and physical alterations mutated the captives into creatures that had special powers of their own. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In time, a leader arose among the enslaved dwarves. Named Laduguer, he struck a deal with Asmodeus, pledging the assistance of clan Duergar against Lolth's ambitions in the Underdark. With
						the help of the Lord of the Nine, the dwarves overthrew their illithid masters in a great uprising. At last, Laduguer could bring his clan upward to rejoin the world they had left behind.
					</p>
					<h4>Triumph Turned Sour</h4>
					<p>
						When Laduguer and his people returned to the dwarves of the upper world, they were shocked by the hostility they faced. As Laduguer quickly learned, the priests of Moradin had long ago
						labeled the lost clan as heretics, spoken of now only as an object lesson concerning the fate of dwarves who stray from Moradin's teachings. When Laduguer protested this treatment, the
						priests insisted that Moradin had sent omens and warnings to the lost dwarves, but they went unheeded. Envoys from the other clans had found clan Duergar's stronghold abandoned, with no
						evidence of invasion, plague, or other calamity. Even worse, the temples of Moradin had been left untended. Only laziness, greed, and contempt for the All -Father could account for the clan's
						fate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Laduguer, in response, tried to explain that his people had been lured into a trap by the mind flayers, but his assertions fell on deaf ears. Thus, with no other apparent choice, the lost
						clan fled back to the Underdark. Laduguer focused his fury on Moradin. The dwarves' supposed father had turned a blind eye as they fell into the mind flayers' trap, then sat idle as the 
						clan suffered unspeakable abuses. Laduguer and his followers swore that they wouldn't rest until the father of the dwarves lay dead and Laduguer sat upon his throne. Of course, by declaring
						his intent to destroy Moradin, Laduguer created a state of war between the duergar and the other dwarves in the world. Since that time, the duergar have not eased up on their hostility, and
						the dwarves have not relaxed their vigilance.
					</p>
					<div class="notes" style="float:right">
						<h4><i>Duergar and Ale</i></h4>
						<p>
							Unlike their dwarven kin, duergar drink alcohol only in moderation and avoid overindulgence. The duergar have learned from bitter experience that those who drink too much risk awakening
							deep racial memories of their ancestors' cruel treatment at the hands of the mind flayers. The psychic agony that these memories evoke manifests in a severe fight-or-flight response. An
							intoxicated duergar might flee in panic and search for a safe place to hide until the effect wears off. A different one might respond by brawling with anyone in the vicinity, venting the
							rage the duergar harbor against their former masters.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Conflict Without End</h4>
					<p>
						Few others aside from the dwarves and the duergar understand or appreciate the true scope and intensity of the battles between these two races. Viewed on a grand scale, the conflict is a
						great war of attrition - the combatants don't often gain or lose territory as the result of battle. But on a personal scale, combat is brutal, with no quarter given or expected. The duergar
						fight a persistent guerrilla war of sudden raids and brutal attacks against isolated groups of dwarves. Duergar often begin an attack by burrowing into a dwarf settlement from below, then
						bursting out in a vicious assault that leaves few survivors. If robbery rather than murder is the goal, a duergar war party might surreptitiously dig for weeks to penetrate a dwarf treasure
						vault, hoping to seize a clan's riches from beneath its noses.
					</p>
					<p>
						For their part, the dwarves keep safety and defense uppermost in their priorities, realizing that there is little to be gained from trying to mount a large-scale assault against the duergar.
						They actively protect their strongholds, keeping careful watch for signs of tunneling, and — dwarven pride being what it is — send bands of warriors out from time to time to deal reprisals to
						duergar camps and fortresses. In addition to these rare offensive thrusts , dwarves sometimes send small squads of explorers or scouts into the Underdark to learn about duergar activity or to
						recover stolen treasures if they can do so without attracting too much attention. This eternal enmity between duergar and dwarves doesn't consume either side; both have other concerns and
						needs that take much of their time and attention, At the same time, the never-ending state of war is never out of mind — every dwarf knows that a chance encounter with a duergar could be
						fatal, and every duergar would like nothing better than to have such an opportunity.

				<h4>Dwarf Traits</h4>
				<div class="racetraits">
					<p>
						<span class="noindent">Y</span>our dwarf character has the following racial traits.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i><span class="noindent">A</span>bility Score Increase:</i></b> Your Constitution score increases by 2.<br>
						<b><i>Age:</i></b> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years<br>
						<b><i>Alignment:</i></b> Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and

						<b><i>Size:</i></b> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.<br>
						<b><i>Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.<br>
						<b><i>Darkvision:</i></b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
						bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
						<b><i>Dwarven Resilience:</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.<br>
						<b><i>Dwarven Combat Training:</i></b> You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and warhammer.<br>

				</div>
				<div class="subrace"> <!-- subraces -->
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Hill Dwarf</span></b><br>

						<b><i>Dwarven Toughness:</i></b> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Mountain Dwarf</span></b><br>
						As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You're probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield

						Underdark.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Strength score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Superior Darkvision:</i></b> Your Darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.<br>

				<h2>Elf</h2>
				<p><i>"I have never imagined such beauty existed," Goldmoon said softly. The day's march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. The companions stood on a high cliff
					over the fabled city of Qualinost. Four slender spires rose from the city's torners like Ostening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from
					spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient domarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an artny, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them
					might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the citys only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. </i><br><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, <i>Dragons of Autumn Twilight</i></p>
				<p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires
					glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good
					things of the world.</p>
				<h4>Slender and Graceful</h4>
				<p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under
					5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than
					females. Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid
					gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>
				<h4>Hidden Woodland Realms</h4>
				<p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for
					clearing and plowing land. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can
					be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance. Like the
					branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat
					from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow,
					and strategy. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted
					items for metals (which they have no interest in mining). Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of
					elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>
				<h4>The Long View</h4>
				<p>Elves have a natural life span of seven centuries or longer. Not surprisingly, this trait affects their attitude and outlook toward every aspect of mortal life. Events from centuries ago that are
					distant or even ancient history to humans might have been experienced firsthand by many elves who are still alive. And an elf's memory of such events is likely more accurate than a
					well-researched historian's account, because the elf can revisit the memory over and over during trance, fixing it more firmly in mind each time. The elven sense of value as it relates to time is
					hard for humans to comprehend. An elf seldom becomes sentimentally attached to physical objects such as manufactured structures and furnishings, except those of personal significance, for the
					simple reason that the object is likely to become decrepit before the elf does. Even fine jewelry and steel swords become tarnished and pitted , succumbing to the ravages of age long before the
					years of their elven owners come to an end.</p>
				<p>Paradoxically, elves pay special interest to the ephemeral: a cloud of mayflies, bubbles in water, illusions, eclipses, rainbows, artistic performances, and so forth. They are fascinated by any
					thing of beauty - an object, creature, scene, or event - that might be experienced only once, but which can be captured in an elf's memory and revisited during trance for the rest of their lives.
					It's a rare elf who forms strong relationships with people of other races, particularly those whose life spans are much shorter. Humans like to believe that elves don't form close bonds with
					them because the elves are saddened whenever they lose a human friend to death, but that's only a portion of the truth. From the elven view, humans' lives are over too soon for elves to forge
					what they consider a real friendship. Among elves, a hundred years of acquaintance between individuals is considered a good foundation for a close relationship. In keeping with their seeming
					aloofness, elves can appear cold and emotionless in the face of tragedy. They do feel the same pain that others feel , and they do mourn their losses. But they also understand , in a way that
					other creatures can't, that all worldly pain is fleeting. Also, if an elf becomes too emotionally invested in a loss, the experience might be relived during trance for centuries to come. Keeping
					some distance between themselves and the concerns of others serves elves best.</p>
				<p>Even though they are stingy with their affection for others, most elves are excellent judges of character. Thus, they can form superficial associations with other creatures very quickly. An elf
					often knows within minutes of meeting someone whether that new acquaintance would be a fitting companion for a journey or an adventure, and their first impressions are seldom wrong - though it
					might be decades later before the relationship becomes deeply personal. The quality of patience, as other races define it, is so in grained in elves that it goes beyond second nature. When
					enemies threaten to invade their domain, elves are just as often satisfied to wait out the danger in their concealed strongholds as to come forth and fight. Remaining out of harm's way for a year
					or even a decade is a small price to pay to avoid bloodshed — because elves, after all, have all the time in the world.</p>
				<h4>Living in Reverie</h4>
				<p>A memory is a curious thing. One can come into consciousness unbidden, evoked by an unexpected scent or the words spoken by a friend. A memory can also be elusive, foiling all attempts to recall
					it and sometimes remembered only after the hunt is abandoned, like a word on the tip of one's tongue. Some memories pull at the heart, weighing it down and holding it there as an anchor moors a
					ship. Others buoy it up or make it flutter joyously like the wings of a bird. Some memories lie in wait like predators, ready to leap out when the mind or the heart is vulnerable. Some linger
					like scars, not always visible but ever-present. Perhaps more so than any other race, elves are familiar with all aspects of memory. From birth, elves don't sleep but instead enter a trance when
					they need to rest. In this state, elves remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories. What an elf remembers during this reverie depends largely on how long the elf
					has lived, and the events of the lives that the elf's soul has experienced before.</p>
				<h4>Childhood</h4>
				<p>Much has been made of the relative fecundity of humans compared to elves. Ignorant folk wonder how elves can live so long, yet have so few children. They cannot know what it means to an elf to
					usher a child into the world. They cannot understand how a birth is both a joy and a sorrow, a reunion and a parting. Each birth represents an elf soul that has been to Arvandor and returned.
					Mortal elves cannot know if it is the soul of someone recently dead or someone who died millennia ago. They cannot even be certain it is an elf of the same world. The only assurance they have is
					that it is an elf of their own kind, for when the primal elves went against Corellon and took permanent shapes, they chose this fate for themselves. How many elves are born to which parents or
					in any given generation is a topic studied by elves in the hope of discerning some sign from Corellon or others of the Seldarine. Aerdrie Faenya, the winged goddess of air and sky, is thought to
					ferry souls from Arvandor into the world, bringing them down from the heavens to begin their mortal lives anew. A decade in which many elves are born across the world is thought to be a
					harbinger of danger that great numbers of elves will be needed to withstand. In contrast, if an elven community goes a century or longer without a new birth, members take this as a sign that the
					community has stagnated and must disband.</p>
				<p>Because of the rarity of elf births, siblings might be separated in age by decades, or even a century or more. Thus, few elves grow up playing with brothers or sisters of similar age and instead
					rely on friends for the development of their social skills. In exceedingly rare cases, a birth might produce twins or - scarcer yet - triplets. These offspring, which the elves refer to as soul
					siblings, are believed to have a special, intertwined destiny that can be fulfilled only if they are raised together. Elf legends are filled with tales of misfortune and tragedy that comes to
					pass when twins are separated and kept too long apart. One might be compelled to reunite with the other, at risk of life and limb; identical twins could become entangled in a case of mistaken
					identity; or the siblings might grow up as opposites, each determined to seek out and defeat the other. During a young elf's first few years, the memories evoked during trance are drawn not from
					current life experiences, but from the fantastic past adventures of the elf's immortal soul. Parents of young elves and priests of Erevan Ilesere encourage the youths to explore these memories
					and talk about them with one another, but they aren't to be discussed with adults until a memory of waking life first intrudes upon a youngster's trance. This experience, called the First
					Reflection, marks the end of childhood and the start of adolescence.</p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Half-Elf, Half Soul?</i></h4>
					<p>
						From the elven perspective, the birth of a half-elf represents a disruption of the natural order of reincarnation. Elves in different communities and across different worlds have numerous
						ideas about the nature of the disruption, because the gods have never given an answer that seems applicable to all. The soul of a half-elf might be an elf soul whose connection to the
						Seldarine has been weakened, or it might be a true elf soul trapped in the body of a half-elf until death, or the soul that lies beneath one's elf-like visage might be human. Many elves,
						especially the younger ones, view the existence of half-elves as a sign of hope rather than as a threat - an example of how elf souls can experience the world in new ways, not bound to a
						single physical form or a particular philosophy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Adolescence</h4>
				<p>Most elves experience their First Reflection in their second or third decade. It marks the beginning of the period when an elf must focus on acquiring the knowledge and skills needed for the elf's
					role as an adult. As a means to this end, elves in adolescence learn how to use trance to evoke memories of their waking lives, giving them opportunities to reflect on the joys of the mortal
					world and to reinforce the principles of any training or practice undertaken while awake. At the same time, the memories of long ago that came so easily during childhood now arise less and less
					frequently. The Drawing of the Veil is the name that elves give to the occasion when a young elf no longer experiences primal memories during trance but instead recalls only the events of its
					current mortal existence.</p>
				<h4>Adulthood</h4>
				<p>The Drawing of the Veil marks an elf's passage into adulthood, which typically occurs at the end of the first century of life. Losing access to one's primal memories can be a traumatic experience.
					Elder elves look for signs of this change in young elves and try to guide them through it. Most elven cultures mark the Drawing of the Veil with a ceremony of pride or celebration, as a way of
					offsetting an individual's melancholy. For some young adults, this might be a time to contemplate Labelas Enoreth, while in another community the Drawing of the Veil is occasion for a celebration
					that invokes gods such as Alobal Lorfiril and Zandilar.</p>
				<p style="width:69%">After the Drawing of the Veil, an elf enters the prime of life, a span of centuries during which most elves strive to engage with the world. An adult elf learns how to control the memories that
					bubble up during trance, choosing to recall experiences from its waking life that enhance its training or give it solace in bad times. This is the stage of elven life that others are most
					familiar with because it's the age when elves move outside their reclusive communities and interact with the larger world. They strive to have a permanent effect on the world, to change things
					for the better (as they see it). Elves want to leave a mark on the world that future generations will remember. Over time, an adult elf can become accomplished in many endeavors while pursuing
					its destiny. It isn't unusual among elves to meet someone who is an expert in disparate disciplines, such as a battle wizard who also is a settlement's best vintner and famous for creating
					delicate wood carvings. This versatility speaks to every adult elf's eagerness for new experiences, because memories of adventures, escapades, and accomplishments will fuel the next and possibly
					longest phase of one's life.</p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Dreams from Beyond Memory</i></h4>
					<p>
						Elves can sleep and dream just like any human, but almost all surface elves avoid doing so. Dreams, as humans know them, are strange and confusing to elves. Unlike the actual memories of
						one's primal soul, present life, or past lives, dreams are uncontrolled products of the subconscious, and perhaps the subconscious minds of those past lives or primal souls as well. An elf
						who dreams must always wonder whose mind these thoughts first arose from, and why. Priests of Sehanine Moon bow are an exception: they sleep and dream to receive signs from their god, and
						elves consult such priests to interpret their own dreams.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Elder Elves</h4>
				<p>At some point during adulthood, the reverie of an elf's trance is first interrupted by a new form of unbidden thought. This seemingly errant memory arises not from the elf's personal experience,
					nor from the memories of the elf's primal soul, but comes from another life and another time. An elf's first experience of this sort is often referred to as the Remembrance and attributed to the
					influence of Labelas Enoreth. Or it is called the Revelation, and Araleth Letheranil is honored for its occurrence. Regardless of its label, this event marks the start of a new phase in an elf's
					life. An elf who begins to experience these other-life memories might live on as normal for decades, but as the intrusions become more frequent , they take their toll on the individual's outlook.
					Eventually, an elfs thoughts start drifting away from worldly accomplishments and turning more and more inward . This change is gradual at first, but it becomes more and more severe until it
					can't be ignored. When that happens, an elf loses interest in the outside world and wants nothing more than to return home, to be surrounded by others of their own kind, to explore the memories
					they've accumulated in this life and keep them separate from the ever-increasing number of other-life memories that are resurfacing.</p>
				<p>Most elves undergo this experience in their third or fourth century. Elves who led extremely active and dangerous lives, such as adventurers, seem to be affected earlier than those who pursue more
					sedate occupations. Notably, elves who have been revived from death by magical means seem to experience their first other-life memory earlier than they otherwise might. Regardless of how soon or
					how often elves experience such memories, most consider them a blessing from the gods. The experiences of other lives that are revisited during trance can be examined for lessons to be applied
					during one's waking life, signs from the gods, or ways to open an elf's perspective to other points of view. A handful of elves in any generation never experience a n other-life memory during
					trance. It's hypothesized that these select few might be reincarnations of the original primal elves who sprang from Corellon's blood and were allowed to stay in his company. Although most elder
					elves become more serene, these rare folk spend the rest of their lives throwing themselves into dangerous situations, as if daring death to try to take them.</p>
				<h4>Aging and Death</h4>
				<p>Most elves don't age outwardly as other humanoids do. The skin of adults remains smooth, their hair does not gray, and their bones do not ache. Even the oldest elves look similar in age to a human
					of perhaps 30 years. Yet there is one sure sign that an elf is nearing the end of life: cataracts in the shape of crescents, points down, that appear over the pupils of both eyes when the elf is
					in trance. This change, commonly known as Transcendence, is evidence that Sehanine Moonbow has opened the door to enable the elf's soul to return to Arvandor - a direct sign from the gods that
					it's time to get one's affairs in order. How much time an elf's body has left is never certain.</p>
				<p>Whether hours or years, the period is marked by both intense joy and great sadness. Most mortal elves accept their upcoming fate with optimism or resignation, but some react by throwing themselves
					back into the labors of life with a frenzy other elves consider unbecoming. Elves who die of old age without experiencing Transcendence are believed to have been denied admission to Arvandor, and
					thus their souls pass on to other planes and are never reincarnated. The living are left to guess why this might be true, but an elf's conduct during life often offers a clue. Drow never
					experience Transcendence, for example, and the same is true for elves who turn to the worship of gods other than the Seldarine.</p>
				<h4>Elf Names</h4>
				<p>From their birth and up until the Drawing of the Veil, elves are called by child names. Upon reaching adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster
					might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members, and little distinction
					exists between male names and female names. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family
					names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>
				<h4>Exploration and Adventure</h4>
				<p>Most surface elves embark on a period of adventuring during their early adulthood. An adventure to an elf, however, isn't always the same as what humans mean when they think of adventure. Humans
					tend to equate adventurers with people who battle monsters, explore dangerous ruins, delve into deep caverns, and generally stir up trouble, usually in pursuit of gold and glory. Elves have been
					known to do all those things, but more typical elf adventurers are simple travelers. Elves know that once they experience Transcendence, the memories they have accumulated will contribute to
					their eternal contentment. So they seek out experiences that will produce exciting, beautiful, or satisfying memories. A few battles against monsters certainly could qualify, but such activities
					aren't usually the focus of an elf's endeavors. Much preferred are memories of faraway places, excellent meals, and fascinating people. As such, most elf "adventurers" are primarily sightseers,
					not valiant crusaders or heroes for hire. This aspect of elven life isn't as well known among other races as it might be, because elves spend much of their "adventuring" years in places far away
					from other societies. They're more interested in remote forests, lonely valleys, high mountains, and other natural places than in cities. Traveling elves want to meet people, but not too many. A
					small fraction of elves are born with or develop the qualities that mark them as potential adventurers, as other races define the term. </p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>The Blessed of Corellon</i></h4>
					<p>
						Ever changing, mirthful, and beautiful, the primal elves could assume whatever sex they liked. When they bowed to Lolth's influence and chose to fix their physical forms, elves lost the
						ability to transform in this way. Yet occasionally elves are born who are so androgynous that they are proclaimed to be among the blessed of Corellon-living symbols of the god's love and of
						the primal elves ' original fluid state of being. Many of Corellon's chief priests bear this blessing. The rarest of these blessed elves can change their sex whenever they finish a long
						rest — a miracle celebrated by elves of all sorts except drow. Dark elves find this ability to be terrifying and characterize it as a curse, for it could destabilize their entire society. If
						Corellon's blessing manifests in a drow, that elf usually flees to the surface world to seek shelter among those dedicated to Corellon.<br>
						You're unlikely to be allowed to play such an elf, but if you want to, ask your DM if you can.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Many traditional adventuring groups are happy to count an elf among their members, and some elves take to this life enthusiastically. Elves have a reputation for remaining unruffled in the face of
					danger, a very good quality to have among folk who regularly find themselves in difficult situations. On extremely rare occasions, an elf might join an adventuring party for reasons that are
					based in fear. A tiny percentage of elves develop an irrational fear of the serene, contemplative life that awaits them in their later years. Even if such a future life seems tepid and unbearably
					dull during an elf's prime, the psychological changes that come with age make this peaceful period of existence the most satisfying experience possible for an elf's later years. Nevertheless,
					this fear is immune to logic when it arises in adult elves. To avoid the fate they dread, consciously or subconsciously, they throw themselves into dangerous situations, not caring whether they
					survive or perhaps even hoping they don't. In effect, they're looking for another chance, seeing their current life or perceived future as unbearable and hoping to stop the clock on this mortal
					body and start afresh.</p>
				<h4>The Seldarine</h4>
				<p>The most ancient tales speak of elves as the children of the god Corellon. Unlike many similar myths involving other races, these tales are true. Elves are all descended from a deity, and their
					origin led to a tragedy that shapes their culture to this day. The gulf between the elves and Corellon , and the split between Corellon and Lolth , arose from the same transgression. That one
					incident set all the many races of elves on their present paths, determined their unique life cycle, and triggered an unflagging hatred between the drow and the elves of the Material Plane</p>
				<p>The pantheon of elven deities, called the Seldarine, includes Corellon and the group of primal elves whom he graced with divinity. These gods were the ones who brought word to Corellon of Lolth's
					radical ideas, and their creator rewarded them with a vast increase in their divine power. When Lolth lured some of the primal elves away from Corellon with her promises, this high-ranking core
					of divine entities remained loyal. Because they rejected Lolth's treacherous ways, they retained their primal power and their immortality. Surface elves, and other elves who dwell in the light,
					revere these entities for remaining true to Corellon. In practice, this reverence is expressed more as the honoring of an ancestor than the worshiping of a god, for all the elves are descended
					from the Seldarine.</p>

				<h4>Eladrin</h4>
				<img loading="lazy" style="width:32%" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Eladrin.png">
				<p>All kinds of elves live in the Feywild, but one subrace - the eladrin - has adopted it as their home. Of all the elves, eladrin are closest in form and ability to the first generation of elves.
					Some could pass for high elves, but most are distinctly eladrin in appearance: very slender, with hair and skin color determined by the season with which they feel the closest affinity. And
					their eyes often glimmer with fey magic. Continued exposure to the Feywild, over a century or more, hastens the onset of Remembrance significantly among most elves. Elves who have spent most of
					their lives in the Feywild can experience their first other-life memory as early as the age of 200 years. Eladrin aren't affected this way. Because of their link to the primal elves, eladrin
					tend to be haughty around other elves. They're proud of their heritage and equally proud of their ability to thrive in the Feywild, a land full of threats that would overwhelm and destroy weaker
					creatures. Some eladrin trade haughtiness for a tender kindness toward their elf cousins, knowing that many elves have never felt the ecstasies of a life amid the fey and of years spent near the
					ancient shrines and other glories created by the primal elves who first arrived in Faerie. These kinder eladrin take a special pleasure in introducing their realm to others.</p>
				<p>Eladrin cities represent the pinnacle of elven architecture. Their soaring towers , arching bridges, and gracefully filigreed homes are a perfect blend of construction natural elements, and
					magic-inspired motifs. Streams and waterfalls, gardens and copses, and structures of stone and wood are commingled in ways that are original and yet completely natural-looking. Eladrin culture
					is older than any other elven civilization, and it's also the most decadent. Most elves are impetuous to some extent, but eladrin are known for their fickleness. Many of them change their minds
					on the spur of the moment without giving reasons. Their system of justice vacillates between capriciously harsh and whimsically mild, depending on the mood of the eladrin passing judgment, and
					eladrin are more susceptible to flattery than other elves are. Elves from the Material Plane who have researched eladrin culture blame these traits on the influence of the Feywild. As part of
					their argument, they point out that eladrin who spend a significant amount of time on the Material Plane - adventurers and scholars, primarily still demonstrate these attitudes, but to a lesser
					degree. Although eladrin have the closest connection to Corellon because of their ancestry, they are alone among elves in feeling little affinity for Arvandor. Eladrin don't long to end their
					cycle of rebirth and rejoin Corellon, but rather to meld with the Feywild when they are reincarnated. They believe that an eladrin who excels in life throughout a series of in carnations can
					eventually come back as a member of the Seelie or Unseelie court or, in extreme cases, even as an archfey.</p>
				<h4>Shadar-kai</h4>
				<p>The shadar-kai are bound to the Raven Queen, cursed to forever serve her in the Shadowfell. They dwell in places outside the Fortress of Memories, usually too terrified of the place to enter it
					willingly. In their communities they reenact their old rituals and ceremonies, in a pale imitation of the days when they dwelled in the life and light of their now-lost kingdom. When shadar-kai
					are in the Shadowfell, their bodies and faces are old and withered, displaying the full effects of the terrible magic that stripped them of their former elven beauty. To hide their visages, they
					often wear masks made of metal or wood, but even these coverings are melancholic in appearance. When shadar-kai are sent away from the Shadowfell to do the Raven Queen's bidding, they take on
					youthful features similar to those of other elves, although their skin remains deathly pale.</p>
				<p>The shadar-kai know that when they die, the Raven Queen captures their souls and returns them to the Shadowfell, where they are resurrected to serve her yet again. Thus, they consider death to be
					a temporary condition, and many shadar-kai care little for the physical shell they currently inhabit.</p>
				<details> <!-- Drow lore -->
					<summary>
						<h2>Drow <span style="color:red; font-size:90%;">☠</span></h2>
					</summary>
					<img loading="lazy" style="width:32%" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Drow.PNG">
					<p>When the primal elves chose to take the forms of mortals, they were one people split by conflicting loyalty to gods who reviled each other. The schism led to a conflict that ended with Lolth
						retreating to the Abyss and her adherents exiled to the Underdark. This banishment enabled the victors to once again live in peace on Arvandor but did nothing to heal the rift. The vanquished
						elves weren't seen or heard from again for centuries. Throughout that age of residing in the darkness, absorbing the unhealthy emanations of the Underdark, subsisting on its tainted water and
						food, and always beseeching their god for guidance and following her poisonous dictates, Lolth's worshipers gradually transformed into the drow: the cruel, predatory, and wicked offshoot of
						the elf race. They are infamous for their cruelty, evilness, and drive to dominate. For much of history, many believed that all drow were beings of inherent and irredeemable evil. In truth,
						most drow do align with evil, engaging in torture, slavery, murder, and other nefarious activities in the name of their demon-goddess. Almost always, dark elves who reject the ways of their
						people are exiled, or executed for being rebels, heretics, and insurrectionists who have turned against drow culture and the will of Lolth. But the existence of noble and self-sacrificing
						drow such as Liriel Baenre and Drizzt Do'Urden suggests that the evil of the drow isn't innate and can be overcome. </p>
					<p>One of the most fervent passions in an elf is the animosity that surface elves and drow hold for one another. This hatred dates back to when the primal elves surrendered their mutable forms
						in response to Lolth's promises. They split into two factions: the drow, who believed that Corellon had held them back and that Lolth's betrayal was justified, and aII other elves, who felt
						bereft of Corellon's presence and believed Lolth had manipulated them from the very beginning. To the drow, every elf who basks in Corellon's light is a weakling and a fool. To most other
						elves, every drow is a traitor. Despite the rift between them, drow and other elves can deal with each other when necessary, avoiding violence for the sake of a common cause. They won't like
						it - they might even hate themselves for a time afterward- but they'll do what must be done according to the circumstances of the situation. Some elves do manage to transcend this hatred.
						They have met or heard of dark elves who find their own paths in life and view each elf as an individual, not as the representative of one side or the other in a cosmic struggle.</p>
					<h4>Reflections of Lolth</h4>
					<p>From the time they're old enough to understand, drow are taught that they're superior to all other creatures, for they remain steadfast in their devotion to Lolth despite the hardships of
						their existence. Any creature that isn't a drow is useful only as a sacrifice to Lolth as a slave or as fodder for the giant spiders that the drow train to patrol their cities and tunnels.
						Among these other, lesser forms of life, the elves that live in sunlight are especially despised because they are descended from the primal elves who betrayed Lolth so long ago. First they
						accepted Lolth's offer of mortality in return for destiny, but then they turned against her in a pathetic effort to win back Corellon 's favor. Drow view the elves of the surface world as
						cowardly children who defy their parents when they're not around but cower in the corner when their parents return, terrified of having their bad behavior found out. Reverence for Lolth
						touches every aspect of drow life. All dark elves constantly watch for signs of her favor. Any incident or physical feature can be interpreted as such a sign, and priestesses are quick to
						attach meanings to obscure omens that benefit their own interests.</p>
					<p>All this effort to please Lolth is a wise precaution. Though she resides in the Abyss, the Spider Queen isn't a distant god. She sometimes tests her most faithful by drawing their spirits to
						her in the Demonweb to undergo her judgment. Followers never know when or if they are to be tested. One who claims to have undergone the test and passed it is rewarded with respect and
						elevated status. Even someone who successfully lies about having taken the test can earn the respect of their peers, since perpetrating this falsehood is a way of proving one's worth to
						Lolth. Lying and conniving can't save those who fail the test, however, because the evidence of such an outcome is immediately obvious - a drow whose spirit has failed its test in the
						Demonweb Pits becomes transformed into a drider. When Lolth is well served, she rewards her faithful with favors. When she is defied, she visits the Underdark in one of her forms and takes
						a direct hand in punishing the malefactor in a manner that discourages anyone who might be contemplating a similar kind of disobedience. Perhaps making an example of malcontents in this way
						is simply an aspect of how Lolth's cruel personality works. It also might be evidence of a lesson that she learned all too well from the way Corellon reacted to her betrayal of him: the
						smallest flame of resistance must be snuffed out before it grows into a conflagration.</p>
					<h4>Rule of Matriarchs</h4>
					<p>Females are the top figures in drow society. At the head of each house is someone who is a shrewd business operator, a skilled tactician, a high priestess of Lolth, and probably also a
						merciless assassin with blood on her hands. Unlike with many other races, female drow are typically taller and more robust than males. To rise to the top echelons of power, a female must
						first become a priestess of Lolth. Then, to ascend to the status of high priestess, she must take advantage of powerful connections or craft special alliances. The path to ultimate power in
						drow society is never direct and is always paved with death. A male drow can advance in standing as a combatant, a consort, or both. Physical beauty and fitness are highly prized in male
						drow, and those who are especially favored in this regard can earn protection and gifts from their matrons. A few males can attain high status in their society, especially those who serve as
						mages, but they never overshadow the females of their houses. Even the most intelligent, strong-willed, and devious male will never be more than a second-class citizen in any drow city or
						house. That situation will never change as long as Lolth reigns as their queen.</p>
					<div class="notes" style="float:right">
						<h4><i>Drow Trance: Entering the Void</i></h4>
						<p>Drow enter trance just as other elves do, but they do not experience memories of a primal soul or of past lives. Often they recall nothing at all, but simply dwell for a time in darkness
							and silence, a respite from the dangers of their daily lives . When drow do dream, whether in trance or in sleep, they look for signs from Lolth or others of the Dark Seldarine. That drow
							do not experience trance the way other elves do lends credence to the idea that their souls do not reincarnate. Did Corellon forever bar the souls of dark elves from Arvandor and change
							them in some fundamental way? Or does Lolth somehow weave new souls for her followers, in the way that Moradin forges new spirits for dwarves? Only those entities know for certain.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Slaves and Status</h4>
					<p>If the drow kept to themselves in their subterranean cities and fortresses, few other creatures would care. The dark elves could indulge their evil practices until their caverns were heaped
						with corpses and awash in blood. Even the surface elves might be content to overlook their hatred for their kin and leave the drow alone, as long as they never had to lay eyes on the drow or
						view the results of their efforts. But drow society is predicated on a foundation of terror and slavery, and the most desirable slaves live on the world's surface: humans , dwarves, and best
						of all, other elves. To the dark elves, raiding the surface for captives and treasure isn't just a cultural and military tradition, but also an economic necessity.</p>
					<p>The drow are known and feared throughout the world for their practice of slavery, but those who have visited their cities report that slaves aren't as prevalent as the dark elves' reputation
						would suggest. In general, only powerful hou ses hold significant numbers of slaves, and the slaves of a house are never more numerous than its population of drow. Slaves are often kept as
						signs of status as much as for their intrinsic worth as laborers. When they are put to work, they are also put on display, doing jobs that enable everyone on the street or in an audience
						chamber to see that their drow master owns and subjugates powerful enemies. As such, the creatures are commonly used as litter bearers, banner carriers, servers, and footstools . Slaves
						without appreciable value as status symbols are used for strenuous or dangerous jobs such as tending farms, hauling cargo, or hollowing out giant stalagmites and stalactites to make new
						dwelling spaces. When they become too weak or dispirited to work, they might be staked out as bait during a hunt, fed to the spiders, or sacrificed to Lolth (and then fed to the spiders).</p>
					<p>Although all slaves are at the bottom of the dark elves' social hierarchy, the lowest-ranking drow are considered little better than slaves themselves. A weak house that doesn't ally itself
						with a protector will be preyed on and victimized into extinction. If it does swear allegiance to a more powerful house, it avoids being persecuted by other houses but becomes effectively a
						clan of indentured servants. Only the most exceptional females in such a clan have any chance of rising above their low station, and those who do advance end up hurting rather than helping
						their families because they are adopted into the more prestigious house, leaving their original house even weaker than before.</p>
					<h4>The Dark Seldarine</h4>
					<p>Lolth demands the lion's share of worship from the drow, according to her wishes and by the command of her priestesses. The Spider Queen isn't, however, the only entity venerated by drow. They
						revere a host of divine entities, which they refer to as the Dark Seldarine in mockery of the surface elves' deities. The Dark Seldarine are mighty, immortal beings, survivors from the
						original group of primal e lves who revolted against Corellon to remain at Lolth's side.</p>

				<h4>Elf Traits</h4>
				<div class="racetraits">
					<p>
						<span class="noindent">Y</span>our Elf character has the following racial traits.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i><span class="noindent">A</span>bility Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</i></b><br>
						<b><i>Age:</i></b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience.
							The life cycle of elves is explained in great detail above, but elves typically reaces what they consider to be adulthood around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.<br>
						<b><i>Alignment:</i></b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They valne and protect others' freedom as weil as their
							own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.<br>
						<b><i>Size:</i></b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.<br>
						<b><i>Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
						<b><i>Darkvision:</i></b> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
							bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
						<b><i>Keen senses:</i></b> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.<br>
						<b><i>Fey Ancestry:</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.<br>
						<b><i>Trance:</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating,
							you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflextve through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
							human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br>
						<b><i>Language:</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs
							and poems are faraons among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.<br>
						<b><i>Subrace:</i></b> A great variety of elven subraces exist across the many worlds of D&D, but only High and Wood elves are usually found as adventurers across the world. Ask your DM if
						you can play any of the other four subraces.<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="subrace">
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">High Elf</span></b><br>
						As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which inciudes the gray elves and
						valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other
						elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often
						encountered among humans and other races. The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden,
						silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but
						various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Elf Weapon Training:</i></b> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
						<b><i>Cantrip:</i></b> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.<br>
						<b><i>Extra Language:</i></b> You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Wood Elf</span></b><br>
						As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of
						Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as weil as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest
						elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves. Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is
						occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Elf Weapon Training:</i></b> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.<br>
						<b><i>Fleet of Foot:</i></b>Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.<br>
						<b><i>Mask of the Wild:</i> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Drow</span></b><br>
						Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white)
						in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Charisma score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Superior Darkvision:</i></b> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.<br>
						<b><i>Sunlight Sensitivity:</i></b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying
						to perceive is in direct sunlight.<br>
						<b><i>Drow Magic:</i></b> You know the <i>Dancing Lights</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <i>Faerie Fire</i> spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also
							cast the <i>Darkness</i> spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br>
						<b><i>Drow Weapon Training:</i> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Shadar-kai</span></b><br>
						Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and
						now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b> Your Constitution score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Necrotic Resistance:</i></b> You have resistance to necrotic damage.<br>
						<b><i>Blessing of the Raven Queen:</i></b> As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until
							you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the s tart of your next turn. During
							that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Eladrin</span></b><br>
						Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent
						of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:<br>
						<b>Spring</b> is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.<br>
						<b>Summer</b> is the season of boldness and aggression. a time of unfettered energy.<br>
						<b>Autumn</b> is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.<br>
						<b>Winter</b> is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.<br>
							Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any
							eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For
							example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an
							eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer. The Backgrounds page offers tables with personality suggestions for Eladrin of each season.<br>
							Choose your eladrin's season: autumn, winter, spring, or summer.<br>
						<b><i>Ability Score Increase:</i></b>Your Charisma score increases by 1.<br>
						<b><i>Fey Step:</i></b> As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short
							or long rest. When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 +your proficiency bonus+ your
							Charisma modifier:<br>
						<b><i>Spring:</i></b> When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your
							choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.<br>
						<b><i>Summer:</i></b> Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of
							1 damage).<br>
						<b><i>Autumn:</i></b> Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
							you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.<br>
						<b><i>Winter:</i></b> When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a>
							of you until the end of your next turn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><span class="noindent">Sea Elf</span></b><br>
						Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents

			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Firbolg</h2>
				<p>Firbolg tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and
					druidic magic.</p>
				<h4>Humble Guardians</h4>
				<p>Firbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and monuments to the durability of
					life. In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a
					bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime. In a
					firbolg's eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems
					and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short?</p>
				<h4>Hidden Shepherds</h4>
				<p>As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don't try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own
					laws. Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the
					firbolgs only when the events affect the forest. Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make
					the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost.
					The firbolgs' presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.
					If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask
					them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs
					explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their
					strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.</p>
				<h4>Natural Druids</h4>
				<p>Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development.
					Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic. Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every
					action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group's needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry
					than strain the land during a famine.</p>
				<h4>Firbolg Classes</h4>
				<p>Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs' magical heritage also expresses itself in other
					ways; those who become bards preserve the clan's lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves. Firbolg rogues are typically
					scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements. Firbolg barbarians are rare except among
					clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders. Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods and are seen as enforcers of that god's will. Firbolg
					warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings. Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of
					a devastated firbolg clan.</p>
				<h4>Firbolg Names</h4>
				<p>Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and
					instead identify the forest's children by their deeds, habits, and other actions. By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer
					to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it "home." Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or
					titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.</p>
				<h4>Outcast Adventurers</h4>
				<p>As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice
					in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category. Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland
					at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home. Orphaned
					firbolgs are those whose clans or homelands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world. A few
					rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to
					complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.</p>

		<div class="container racecont"> <!-- Gith -->
			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Gith</h2>
				<p>The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in
					servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge . That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the
					two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.</p>
				<p>The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of
					chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they
					share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.</p>
				<p>The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral
					Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers
					whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them. </p>
				<h2>Githzerai</h2>
				<img loading="lazy" title="I am placeholder" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Githz.PNG">
				<p>The githzerai were born as a race at the end of the gith's bloody, genocidal uprising against the mind flayers. A gith named Zerthimon, who had gained a significant following during the conflict,
					challenged Gith's plans and her leadership. Gith was evil , the newcomer proclaimed, and she would lead the people into darkness and tyranny not unlike the one imposed by the illithids. Thus,
					no sooner had the gith defeated their sworn enemies than they were plunged into a bitter civil war. In the ensuing conflict, Zerthimon was killed and his followers, naming themselves githzerai,
					relocated their civilization to the plane of Limbo. Today, under the leadership of the Great Githzerai, Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the githzerai continue to stand fast against the githyanki, as well
					as taking their revenge on the mind flayers . Through forays into the Material Plane and other realms, they provide stiff opposition to their enemies' plans for world domination.</p>
				<h4>Order in a Sea of Chaos</h4>
				<p><i>We githzerai crave a challenge, so that when Zerthimon returns he shall find us ready. Thus we traveled to howling Limbo to make our new home.</i> — The Teachings of Menyar-Ag</p>
				<p>Strong-minded philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Their society focuses on enhancing the potential of the mind through meditation, education, and physical
					tests. The most accomplished among them stand as exemplars of the githzerai's monastic principles, but even those who perform mundane duties in a community have a significant measure of the same
					mental fortitude. Living in the ever-turbulent churn of Limbo requires all githzerai to harness the power of thought to counteract and hold at bay the chaos-stuff of the plane. If they were not
					relentless in this effort, the tides of Limbo would overwhelm and destroy them. The githzerai have a unity of purpose that comes from their reverence for their great heroes and their desire to
					emulate the virtues of those figures in their everyday lives.</p>
				<h4>Menyar-Ag, the Great Githzerai</h4>
				<p>Menyar-Ag led the githzerai into Limbo at the culmination of the conflict between Gith and Zerthimon. Thanks to unimaginable arcane and psionic power, he has survived far beyond the life span of
					an ordinary githzerai. Time has nevertheless taken its toll , and Menyar-Ag today is a decrepit, corpse-like entity- capable of tremendous feats of magic and psionics but barely able to move a
					finger or lift his own eyelids. A host of servants constantly attend to Menyar-Ag and see to his ever y need. Although Menyar-Ag is no longer capable of physical actions of any consequence, his
					mind is as active and sharp as ever. He never sleeps, using a rotating staff of attendants to spread his commands and counsel to all githzerai. If needed, he can call upon his own psychic energy
					to contact his people, even across the planes.</p>
				<h4>Zerths</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>The Gith Alphabet</i></h4>
					<p>The gith use a written language composed of alphabetic symbols arranged in circular clusters called tir'su. Each "spoke" on the wheel corresponds to a letter of the alphabet. Each cluster of
						characters represents a single word, and multiple tir'su connect to form phrases and sentences. Githyanki and githzerai both speak Gith, but each race has a distinct dialect and accent.
						Similarly, the two races of gith differentiate their language by how they write it. Githyanki write a tir'su clockwise, starting at the top. Githzerai use the same letter symbols but write
						their tir'su counterclockwise, starting from the bottom.</p>
				</div>
				<p>Zerthimon's mortal form died in battle, but his sacrifice freed the githzerai from Gith's dark designs. They believe that Zerthimon, in his new godly form , will return someday and usher them
					into new age of freedom. Until that happens, the githzerai known as zerths fill the symbolic role of Zerthimon in society, as accomplished wielders of psionic power who can move themselves and
					others between planes. The githzerai believe that when Zerthimon returns, he will first gather all the zerths and take them to their new paradise to prepare it for those who follow. Zerths are
					similar to what other races would call priests, although githzerai don't have a religion as such, beyond their admiration for Zerthimon and Menyar-Ag.</p>
				<h4>Githzerai in the World</h4>
				<p><i>Zerthimon does not expect us to wait in patience for his return. instead, we must pave the way for his efforts, so that we can hasten the coming of our golden age.</i> — The Teachings of
					Menyar-Ag</p>
				<p>It's natural for githzerai to prefer to remain in Limbo. They have carved out a well-ordered civilization in an environment that they can freely manipulate with their minds. When they visit other
					realms, particularly the Material Plane, githzerai feel sluggish and aren't comfortable functioning in a landscape that they see as being locked in immutability. Despite their disinclination
					toward travel, the githzerai send groups away from Limbo on a regular basis to keep from giving ground in their battles against the githyanki and the mind flayers.</p>
				<h2>Githyanki <span style="color:red; font-size:90%;">☠</span></h2>
				<img loading="lazy" title="I am placeholder" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Githy.png">
				<p><i>Under the illithids, we and the githyanki fought and died across a thousand worlds for implacable masters. Under Vlaakith, our kin fight and die across a thousand words for an implacable
					master. And they call that liberation?</i> — Adaka Fell Hand, githzerai monk</p>
				<p>Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become corrupt raiders and destroyers under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith. They dwell on the Astral Plane
					in the city of Tu'narath, a metropolis built on and in the corpse of a deity. Vlaakith commands the loyalty of the githyanki from her personal stronghold, Susurrus, also called the Palace of
					Whispers, which is located deep inside the floating city.</p>
				<p>From birth, githyanki are conditioned to fight and die for their queen. Children endure a brutal upbringing that constantly preaches devotion to Vlaakith. Each of the fortified settlements where
					young githyanki are raised and trained is a combination of military academy and cult headquarters.</p>
				<h4>The Revered Queen</h4>
				<p><i>To slay in her name is our greatest service. To die in her name is our last act of reverence.</i> — Meldavh, githyanki knight</p>
				<p>Vlaakith sits at the center of everything concerning the githyanki. She is their ruler in every sphere of activity and, as such, demands and receives utter obedience. During the war with the
					illithids, Vlaakith urged Gith to seek out allies from among the planes and in particular advised her to seek counsel with Tiamat. Gith agreed to venture into the Nine Hells to forge an alliance
					with the Queen of Dragons. She didn't return. Instead, the great red dragon Ephelomon brought news to the gith: Tiamat had pledged many of her red dragon servants to the gith cause. They would
					refrain from attacking gith and would provide support against the illithids and protection for the gith's outposts on the Material Plane. In return, a few select young dragons would serve
					alongside the gith for a time, for purposes known only to Tiamat. Ephelomon also proclaimed that Vlaakith was to rule in Gith's place until she returned. After the gith overthrew the mind flayers
					and Zerthimon's followers began to emerge as a threat to Gith's preeminence, Vlaakith played a critical role in ensuring that the githyanki under her rule were protected from an immediate, direct
					assault by their kin. Using her mastery of arcane magic, she helped the githyanki establish a permanent stronghold on the Astral Plane. From there, she began making plans to strike back at both
					the hated mind flayers and the traitorous githzerai.</p>
				<h4>The Grand Proclamation</h4>
				<p>Vlaakith cemented her position as the supreme ruler of the githyanki with a grand proclamation that defined the githyanki's all-encompassing mission. They had been bred and trained for war by
					their one-time masters and had never known anything other than a martial existence. They needed a clear purpose and a forceful commander to spur them on, and Vlaakith provided both. Vlaakith
					decreed that, having defeated the mind flayers, the githyanki would take the place of the illithids as sovereigns of the Material Plane. The many worlds of the Material Plane would be the
					githyanki's gardens, prime for harvesting as they saw fit. The Astral Plane would be their home domain, because in that timeless realm they could ignore the need for food , water, and other
					mundane concerns that plague lesser races. Vlaakith also proclaimed that githyanki who proved themselves skilled in battle would ascend to an even greater paradise. A long lifetime of service
					would earn any githyanki a journey to the boundless delights of her innermost court- the wondrous realm that Gith discovered in her journeys, and where she awaits those who have proven themselves
					worthy.</p>
				<h4>The Bitter Truth</h4>
				<p>In the time since Vlaakith made this promise to her people, she has called many of the most formidable githyanki warriors to their reward. At the culmination of a grand ceremony that supposedly
					readies them for their journey to where Gith awaits, the supplicants enter her inner sanctum and are never seen again. In truth, instead of sending them to paradise, Vlaakith drains their souls
					and absorbs their strength, gaining more power with every "ascension." Her knowledge of arcane magic equals that of a conclave of archmages, while her combat skill matches the combined talents of
					hundreds of sword masters. Perhaps the lich-queen's promise isn't a complete fabrication, but no others can say for sure. If Vlaakith knows anything more, she has taken drastic measures to keep
					it secret. A few sages and spellcasters have sought to learn the truth about Gith's fate using arcane magic, only to fall victim to a bizarre curse that transforms them into the formless
					creatures known as allips. All attempts to learn about Gith through divine magic return utter silence. Those who try experience a strange sensation, as if their minds were teetering on the edge
					of a great abyss, one that spans time, space, and memory.</p>
				<h4>Only the Best Survive</h4>
				<p>The githyanki raise their young in hidden crèches that they construct in far-Rung places on the Material Plane. Such measures are necessary because birth and growth are impossible on the Astral
					Plane, whose occupants don't age. The adult overseers in these places train young githyanki to harness their psychic and physical abilities. Githyanki hatch from eggs. Each newborn enters the
					world alongside other eggs deliberately laid so that all hatch at the same time. Since githyanki adults must return to the Astral Plane to keep from aging significantly, the roster of instructors
					continually changes, with no adult staying longer than a few months and none ever returning for a second stint. The instruction that young githyanki undergo is unrelenting and unforgiving. As a
					crop of youngsters grows older, more and more is demanded from each student, and the penalties for failing to keep up become more and more severe. In the early stages, combat practice lasts only
					until a wound is scored. Later, near the end of training, a drill of the same sort might be a fight to the death - the ultimate way of weeding out all those who don' t meet Vlaakith's standards.
					To the githyanki, it's better for a weakling to die in training than to undertake a mission and imperil a war band.</p>
				<h4>Indolent Dilettantes</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>The Sha'sal Khou</i></h4>
					<p>The Sha'sal Khou is an organization of githyanki and githzerai radicals working toward the reunification of their peoples. They want to bring about the end of the warfare between the githyanki
						and githzerai and the creation of a new unified nation of all gith. Members of the Sha'sal Khou work secretly within their respective societies, subtly discouraging attacks on the other gith
						race while looking for signs of like-minded individuals who might be recruited. The group maintains hidden redoubts on the Material Plane as well. The goal of the organization is to raise a
						proper army and establish a fortified enclave where children will grow up calling themselves simply "gith." The group's most high-ranking advocate in the githyanki hierarchy is a powerful
						warlord named Zetch'r'r. He secretly supports the reunification of the githyanki and the githzerai, and works behind the scenes to turn others toward the cause.</p>
				</div>
				<p>As a race bred and shaped by the mind flayers for a life of fighting, the githyanki never knew anything else while they were enslaved. Now that they aren't constantly at war, keeping her people
					occupied is perhaps the greatest challenge Vlaakith faces. When githyanki aren't on raids or other missions for Vlaakith, they enjoy a languid existence in Tu'narath. Since time doesn't pass on
					the Astral Plane, the githyanki have no need to labor for food or water. To keep their minds sharp, Vlaakith orders them to pursue a variety of arts and studies. She regularly arranges contests,
					scavenger hunts, and other trials to keep her servants involved in purposeful activity, but the attraction of such diversions wears off after a brief time. Most of the citizens ofTu'narath, when
					they haven't been called for duty on a raid or for some other mission , indulge themselves in any way they see fit. Githyanki, with an infinite amount of time on their hands, crave novelty. They
					expect every returning raid to provide new forms of entertainment. This preoccupation with newness stands at the hollow center of githyanki culture. They dabble in creating art, but never master
					it. They stand among treasures taken from countless worlds but are never truly appreciative of them. The githyanki flit from topic to topic, craft to craft, never settling on one endeavor for
					long. Tu'narath is littered with half-built sculptures, partially completed frescoes, and other unfinished works of all sorts. The githyanki simply abandon personal projects that bore them, and
					every such endeavor they undertake ends in this manner.</p>
				<h4>A Blade Kept Sharp</h4>
				<p>Despite the decadent lifestyle the githyanki indulge in, they remain in fighting shape. All are required to attend weapon and combat drills, which serve as a brief respite from their boredom.
					Vlaakith, of course, stands atop the githyanki military hierarchy. Under her serve the supreme commanders, each of whom oversees a regiment of one thousand githyanki warriors. Ten kith'rak, each
					responsible for a company of one hundred, answer to a commander. Each kith'rak in turn commands ten sarths, each of whom leads a party of ten warriors. A githyanki war leader retains that status
					in times of peace, looking after their underlings and maintaining their discipline and combat training.</p>

			<div class="Standard">
				<h2>Gnome</h2>
				<p><i>Skinny and flaxen-haired, his skin walnut brown and his eyes a startling turquoise, Burgell stood half as tall as Aeron an had to climb up on a stool to look out the peephole. Like most
					habitations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could. But at least the relative largeness of the
					apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted
					lenses, jeweler's loupes, and fars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage's familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a
					disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep.</i><br><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— Richard Lee Bryers, <i>The Black Bouquet</i></p>
				<p>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor
					explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially borsts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and
					play.</p>
				<p>Love of discovery is the force that drives the life of a gnome, whether one is investigating the nature of magic or trying to invent a better back scratcher. Questions about the world fill a
					gnome's head: how an insect flies, a fish swims, or a grasshopper jumps - they want to figure it all out! But it's not just nature and its workings that intrigue them; gnomes become obsessed with
					all sorts of topics. In particular, they have a keen interest in mechanical devices, the natural world, and magical pursuits; a gnome might seek to invent a new garden tool, collect and
					categorize every type of butterfly, or develop a new method for cutting gemstones.</p>
				<h4>Vibrant Expression</h4>
				<p>A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are
					usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing
					the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around. A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed
					but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p>
				<h4>Delighted Dedication</h4>
				<p>A gnome is rarely bored and tries to savor every minute, for life is full of opportunities to learn, to help others, and to have fun. Gnomes are born with a fascination for learning fueled by an
					irrepressible curiosity. Most individuals settle on a specialized area of study such as an aspect of the natural world, a particular method of invention, or the patterns that underlie the
					multiverse. Though this pursuit of knowledge might compel a gnome to spend long periods in the workshop or the laboratory, the activity is never seen as drudgery - quite the opposite. Gnomes
					enjoy making an unexciting aspect of life more enjoyable, such as inventing a shovel that whistles a tune to lighten the toil of digging, or creating a telescoping fork that can reach across the
					table to enliven mealtime. Their fun-loving attitude also comes through in the form of jokes that gnomes tell to, or about, their companions, and in the good-spirited pranks that they play on
					each other — and on other folk (who might not always appreciate being the target of their humor).</p>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Always Appreciative</i></h4>
					<p>
						It's rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless they have suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don't share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone's company
						just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Bright Burrows</h4>
				<p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are
					well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the
					first place. Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious
					learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</p>
				<h4>Gnome Names</h4>
				<p>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might
					or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are
					"stuffy" about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that's the most fun to say.</p>
				<h4>Gnome Adventurers</h4>
				<p><i>I don't know how many times I've seen a gnome tum a dead end into a wonderful opportunity.</i> — Delaan Winterhound</p>
				<p>When a gnome leaves the burrow, the force behind that decision is almost always curiosity - an insatiable need to seek out and experience what the world has to offer. Sometimes the adventuring
					life is the natural outgrowth of a gnome's research project or experiment. A rock gnome alchemist who discovers a new form of fungus growing in a nearby cavern might wander farther afield from
					the burrow, looking for knowledge about other fungi in the world. A forest gnome who hears about a master illusionist in a faraway realm could embark on a journey to find that person and learn
					new tricks. A rock gnome artificer might become determined to locate any deposits of a rare metal, willing to travel the world high and low in search of it. Even a deep gnome might be born with
					an irrepressible urge to leave the Underdark and join a group to pursue a life of shared purpose. Some gnome communities make a practice of sending young adults away from the burrow as a rite of
					passage, encouraging them to explore the realms of humans, dwarves, and elves for a time, with instructions to bring back information and new ideas for the community. Most of these folk return to
					the burrow at the appointed time or even sooner, their curiosity having been satisfied. But a few of them take readily to life in the outside world and don't come back on schedule, returning to
					the burrow only after spending years or decades away as a member of an adventuring party.</p>
				<h4>Gnome Gods</h4>
				<p><i>Who forged the chains that bind Tiamat in Avernus? Why do the modrons go on the Great March? Who is the Lady of Pain, really!? I can't tell you. but the answers lie in the Golden Hills. And if
					Garl and his gang don't know, it can't be known.</i> — Griballix, gnome of Sigil</p>
				<p>It shouldn't be surprising that gnomes, inveterate inventors that they are, have an incredible number of legends they tell about their deities. Every warren has its unique repertoire of tales —
					some of them no doubt grounded in fact, while others could be the products of imagination. The distinction isn't important to the folk who take inspiration and pride from the stories of their
					gods, because each legend is true in its own way. Each deity in the gnome pantheon is an expert in multiple fields of activity who is capable of incredible feats. Yet these heroes also display
					shortcomings, such as hesitance or selfishness. Only the chief gnome deity, Garl Glittergold, can convince the others to set aside personal concerns to embark on a grand excursion or to work
					together toward a common goal. And according to the gnomes, it is proven that their gods can accomplish the impossible when they band together.</p>
				<p>A curious bit of gnomish lore is that the pantheon counts not a single female within its ranks. Legend has it that the mysterious Ladies of the Golden Hills went away together on some task in the
					most ancient days, and have not yet returned. The stories differ as to the Ladies' task, from seeking to gather examples of all of the beauty and riches of Toril, to a secret plan to thwart the
					evils of the world using their anonymity as a shield, causing the world to forget even their names and identities for a time. Gnomes who wander far from home are said to have "gone looking for
					the Ladies."</p>

				<h2>Forest Gnomes</h2>
				<p>The reclusive forest gnomes live simply in hillside dwellings deep in the woods. A neighbor could live only a few miles from a forest gnome settlement for a lifetime and never know it. In these
					communities, anonymity and stealth help to ensure protection, peace, and survival. Forest gnome settlements often escape notice. Roving hunters can wander through without ever suspecting they
					are walking through anything but wilderness. A community of elves might be surprised to discover they have been neighbors of a forest gnome village for years.  If they are discovered and treated
					well, forest gnomes make fine neighbors, but they usually avoid contact even with civilizations that seem friendly. Forest gnomes use their affinity with small animals and their knack for
					illusions to help them remain hidden. When necessary, a forest gnome community defends itself with all the resources at its disposal. Many settlements, however, simply vanish if they are
					discovered, retreating to some uncharted corner of the forest to begin anew. The rare forest gnomes who leave their people to become adventurers often draw upon their closeness to nature and
					their magical gifts to serve as guides, scouts, or mystics. Living close to nature also makes forest gnomes likely to take up roles as druids, who serve various forest spirits and deities.</p>
				<p>Forest gnomes are good at making their homes vanish into the landscape. It helps that they are small folk, and that they fashion their homes by digging down and living within rather than building
					up and living above. Like the badgers and raccoons that are often their companions, they live in the hollows of trees and warrens dug into hillsides, each home connected to the others in the
					community by elaborate burrows. Beyond the secret doors into their houses, the homes of forest gnomes are gaily decorated, tidy spaces that take advantage of natural features. A great glass bowl
					swimming with fish and frogs might serve as a skylight for a gnome burrow, while appearing to the world above as a small pond. The gnarled and tangled roots of a tree might be used for shelves,
					seats, tables, and bed spaces. Such houses often have many little channels open to the outside, allowing scraps of sunlight to dapple the walls and floors and providing a means of egress for the
					many animals that live with the gnomes. Similar small openings are used for their cleverly hidden chimneys, disguised as tree branches, which carry smoke from their small fires high into the
					treetops, reducing it to little more than a haze before it disperses.</p>
				<h4>Animal Helpers</h4>
				<p>Forest gnomes can communicate with many of the small animals of the woods. Squirrels, raccoons, foxes, weasels, owls, rabbits, robins, hummingbirds, and more are their allies and friends.
					Outsiders often think of these creatures as the gnomes' pets, but the gnomes treat them more like trusted neighbors. When strangers approach a woodland inhabited by forest gnomes, the gnomes
					often know about it while such visitors are still miles away. Speedy squirrels run through the treetops, each trying to be the first to warn the gnomes and earn a sweet treat. Birds trill a
					special call that alerts the gnomes to danger. At night, nocturnal animals such as owls and bats carry word to the gnomes during times when they should be on their guard.</p>
				<h4>Experts in Illusion</h4>
				<p>Forest gnomes have innate magical ability, letting them create simple illusions. They practice the use of illusion magic from an early age. Most forest gnome communities include a full-fledged
					illusionist and an apprentice or two, and they use their talents in service of the community - designing longer-lasting or larger-scale illusions that help the community stay hidden from the
					world. Gnomes use illusions for practically any reason- as a game, for defense, or for communication- and sometimes for no reason other than artistic considerations. A simple illusion can often
					express a complex idea, such as when the memory of a location is triggered by the illusory sound of a babbling brook that runs through the place. A storytelling session conducted by a group of
					forest gnomes is a riot of sounds and images that helps give meaning and intensity to the tale being told. It is a kind of entertainment unfathomable by most other races, whose stories and
					performances are limited by whatever materials are on hand.</p>
				<p>The forest gnomes' playful nature shows through in the illusions they create, even those that have a serious purpose. (An illusion that conceals the entrance to a tunnel by making it look like
					solid earth might not amuse other folk, but the gnomes get a good laugh out of it.) Forest gnomes spend their spare time experimenting with the creation of never-before-seen illusions, or
					embellishing the images and sounds they already know how to produce. The number of ways in which forest gnomes use illusions to have fun is nearly limitless. A few examples: visual enhancements
					to a mythic tale told by an elder, new and interesting sounds, and false doors and hallways to fool intruders and lead them into traps. (Goblins just can't pass by a door that calls them names.)</p>
				<h2>Rock Gnome</h2>
				<p>Unlike their shy forest cousins, the inquisitive and irrepressible rock gnomes interact regularly with individuals of other races, especially if those individuals have something to teach them.
					Rock gnomes prefer to live on the edges of other settlements in their own enclaves, though the occasional adventuresome rock gnome takes up residence in a human or dwarven city. Rock gnomes who
					leave their communities often find work by using their racial aptitudes to their advantage. Their heritage and their interest in precious stones leads many rock gnomes to become skilled
					gemcutters and jewelers. Rock gnomes also use their affinity with machines to work as tinkers, alchemists, and engineers. In human communities, gnome tutors and sages are popular, since their
					comparatively long life spans enable them to acquire and pass on knowledge for generations.</p>
				<p>A visitor's first steps into a rock gnome warren are accompanied by the sounds of industry - hammers rapping on metal, chisels chewing wood, cauldrons bubbling, and a host of assorted squeaks,
					pings, and whistles. Against this backdrop, the halls echo with the voices of rock gnome inventors jabbering at near unintelligible speed about their latest ideas, and the hubbub is occasionally
					punctuated by a big bang or the abrupt collapse of some unstable contraption. To rock gnomes, life is a combination of scavenger hunts and periods of bold experimentation. First they mine
					materials from within the earth, and then they figure out what they can create or invent using those resources. The discovery of a new vein of metal — whether tin, copper, silver, or gold — makes
					rock gnomes clap their hands with glee, but they are happiest of all when they find a cache of gems, particularly diamonds. Individual rock gnomes have different ideas about what sorts of
					inventions are the most satisfying to create, with some favoring practicality and others more interested in artistic expression. In each group, there are those who prefer to practice the
					alchemical arts and those whose talents lean toward the creation of mechanical devices. Every warren has members of each persuasion, and they are all bound by mutual respect for what they do
					despite their different perspectives.</p>
				<h4>Practice Makes Perfect</h4>
				<p>Rock gnomes who take a more scientific approach to inventing are the ones responsible for creating technological devices that make life easier. Even an invention as simple as a new kind of rake
					is celebrated, and that advance might later be superseded by someone who modifies it in a way that makes it more efficient or more enjoyable to use. These inventors are rarely reluctant to try
					making devices of exceptional power, even if one might not work at first the way it was intended to. The gnomes know that it's always possible for someone else to learn from an inventor's
					mistakes, so even a failed experiment is a success in some way. Every minor explosion or other incident of turmoil in a rock gnome burrow serves as a clue about what not to do next time — unless,
					of course, the goal was to make something explode.</p>
				<h4>Tunnel Vision</h4>
				<p>When they are at work, rock gnomes hole up in their workshops with "Do Not Disturb" signs hung on the door. It isn't uncommon for gnomes who are working on their projects to spend most of their
					time in seclusion, and even when they emerge (for meals or other reasons), they are often deep in thought and oblivious of their surroundings. In the safety of the burrow, they seldom come to
					harm because of this vulnerability. But even city-dwelling gnomes can fall prey to this sort of obsession as they pursue their projects, and in such cases it's much safer for them to stay in
					their homes, since a gnome wandering the streets deep in thought is liable to walk into a moat or be run over by a wagon.</p>
				<h2>Deep Gnome</h2>
				<p>Deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, are the pragmatic and often grumpy cousins of the gnome family, who live deep underground. The Underdark is full of danger, meaning that deep gnomes spend much of
					their time simply staying alive. They endure this life because the Underdark also holds incredible treasures: minerals and gemstones, gold, silver, and platinum. The svirfneblin mine these
					materials whenever they find a new deposit-especially rubies, which they prize above all other treasure. The svirfneblin do take pleasure from success in these mining operations. A thin smile
					emerges from the stonelike features of a deep gnome who finds a truly remarkable gem, and such a discovery lightens the mood in the enclave for a time.</p>
				<p>Deep gnomes are lean with dark, earthen skin tones of gray. Males are bald and beardless, while females have hair on their heads. Both sexes have little or no body hair and a stone-like look to
					their skin. Deep gnome adventurers are just as curious and daring as those of other races. Some find their purpose living among other subterranean races, and a few make their way to the surface.
					Those who study the arcane arts of illusion in particular often range far from home, seeking knowledge unavailable in their own lands.</p>
				<h4>Hidden But Homey</h4>
				<p>Owing to the hostility of their Underdark neighbors, particularly the drow, the settlements and kingdoms of svirfneblin are in constant danger of being relocated, conquered, or destroyed. Deep
					gnomes protect their enclaves with labyrinthine tunnels, traps, and armed guards, all designed to make the entrance to a settlement uninviting. But inside its borders, a deep gnome settlement is
					a warren shaped and decorated by the svirfneblin to make the place welcoming and comfortable. Although they are skilled stonemasons, svirfneblin appreciate the beauty of natural stone and prefer
					either to carve to accentuate its features or to leave it unchanged. Their architecture is marked by smooth, curving shapes rather than straight lines and hard edges. Svirfneblin are intensely
					community-minded and have little concern about privacy among themselves. Thus, they don't close off living spaces with doors or window coverings. Most of their homes are sparsely furnished
					dwellings of one or two rooms. Bed spaces, often carved into the cavern walls, are strung with hammocks for each inhabitant, but often are otherwise empty except for stone coffers holding a few
					personal effects.</p>
