			<h1 id="introtocombat">An Introduction to Combat</h1>
			<img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/7/b/7bb41fa6-0cc6-43e5-9aa8-fcd9c781f4ce.jpg">
			<p>
				The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard's spell. The
				sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling. This page provides
				the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules
				address you, the player or Dungeon Master.
			</p>
			<p>
				A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and
				turns. A <b>round</b> represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a <b>turn</b>. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat
				encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
			</p>
			<h4 id="initiative">Combat Step By Step</h4>
			<ol style="margin-left:-15px;">
				<li><b>Determine Surprise.</b> The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.</li>
				<li><b>Establish positions.</b> The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM
					figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.</li>
				<li><b>Roll initiative.</b> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.</li>
				<li><b>Take turns.</b> Each parlicipant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.</li>
				<li><b>Begin the next round.</b> When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Surprise</h4>
			<p>
				A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=GelatinousCube"><b>gelatinous cube</b></a> glides down a dungeon passage,
				unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other. The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side
				tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on
				the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the
				combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.
			</p>
			<h4>Initiative</h4>
			<p>
				Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an
				entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the
				lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among
				tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. If the tie is between a monster and a player character, the DM can unilaterally decide the order, or have
				them roll a die to determine it, at their own option.
			</p>
			<h2 id="yourturn">Your Turn</h2>
			<p>
				On your turn, you can <b>move</b> a distance up to your speed, <b>take one action</b>, and sometimes <b>take a bonus action</b>. You can do the three in any order you please. The most common actions
				you can take are described under "Actions in Combat" below. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action. See the "Movement" section below for the rules on how
				you can move. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action.
			</p>
			<h4>Actions in Combat</h4>
			<p>
				When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented below, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have
				action options of their own in their stat blocks. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the roles, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to
				make, if any, to determine success or failure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Contests in Combat</b><br>
				Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. Below, the Overrun and Tumble actions require contests. So do the disarming,
				grappling, and shoving attack variants on the "Attacks & Damage" tab. The DM can use these contests as models for improvising others.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Improvising an Action</b><br>
				Your character can do things not covered by the actions below, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only
				limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character's ability scores. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is
				possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
			</p>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Attack">
				<summary>Attack</summary>
				<p>
					The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or
					ranged attack. <a href="?l=attacksanddamage">"Attacks & Damage"</a> for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more
					than one attack with this action.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="CastaSpell">
				<summary>Cast a Spell</summary>
				<p>
					Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the
					caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a
					spellcaster often uses their action in combat to cast such a spell. See <a href="?l=spellcasting">"Spellcasting"</a> for the rules on spellcasting.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="ClimbontoaBiggerCreature">
				<summary>Climb onto a Bigger Creature</summary>
				<p>
					If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by <a href="?f=GrapplingaCreature">grappling</a>. A Small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple
					against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into
					position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
					If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space and clings to its body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature moves with the target
					and has advantage on attack rolls against it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the
					smaller creature's location, and is left to the DM's discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and
					throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Dash">
				<summary>Dash</summary>
				<p>
					When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30ft, for example, you can move up to
					60ft on your turn if you dash.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30ft is reduced to 15ft, for instance, you can move up to 30ft this turn if
					you dash. The Dash action itself doesn't change your movement speed, so if you somehow take it twice—such as by using the rogue's Cunning Action feature—with a speed of 30ft, the extra movement
					you gain is a total of 60ft, not 90.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Disengage">
				<summary>Disengage</summary>
				<p>
					If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Dodge">
				<summary>Dodge</summary>
				<p>
					When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you
					make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are <a href="./combat.html?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a> or if your speed drops to 0.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Help">
				<summary>Help</summary>
				<p>
					You can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. When you take the Help action, you feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack
					more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, their first attack roll is made with advantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, you can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. The creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping
					with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. You normally have to be within 5ft of the creature you're aiding, but certain circumstances, as determined by the DM,
					might allow you to help from a distance.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Hide">
				<summary>Hide</summary>
				<p>
					When you take the Hide action, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that
					actively searches for signs of your presence, such as with the Search action. You can't hide from a creature that can see you. and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a
					vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet. If you
					successfully hide, you gain certain benefits, as described under <a href="?f=UnseenAttackers">"Unseen Attackers and Targets"</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might
					allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to remain unseen.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Passive Perception</b><br>
					When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that
					creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,
					subtract 5. For example, if a 1<sup>st</sup>-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom
					(Perception) of 14.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">What Can You See?</b><br>
					One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained on the "Other
					Rules (or adventuring if I add such a page)" page.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Overrun">
				<summary>Overrun</summary>
				<p>
					When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a
					Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile
					creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Ready">
				<summary>Ready</summary>
				<p>
					Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using
					your reaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in
					response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."
				</p>
				<p>
					When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and
					holding onto the spell's magic requires <a href="?f=Concentration">concentration</a>. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are
					concentrating on the <a href="./spells.html?l=Web"><i>Web</i></a> spell and ready <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>, your <a href="./spells.html?l=Web"><i>Web</i></a>
					spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Search">
				<summary>Search</summary>
				<p>
					When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence
					(Investigation) check.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="Tumble">
				<summary>Tumble</summary>
				<p>
					A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested
					by the hostile creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="cmbtactn" id="UseanObject">
				<summary>Use an Object</summary>
				<p>
					You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object
					action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h4>Bonus Actions</h4>
			<p>
				Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus
				action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to
				take. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
			</p>
			<p>
				Casting a spell as a bonus action on the same turn as casting another spell with a casting time of 1 action is not allowed, except if that other spell is a cantrip.
			</p>
			<h4>Reactions</h4>
			<p>
				Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on
				someone else's. The <a href="?l=meleeatks">opportunity attack</a> is the most common type of reaction. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If
				the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack and the Ready action for most of their reactions in a fight. Various spells and features give a creature more reaction options, and sometimes the
				timing of a reaction can be difficult to deduce. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's description. For example, the opportunity attack and the
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Shield"><i>Shield</i></a> spell are clear about the fact that they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing specified, or the timing is unclear, the
				reaction occurs after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action.
			</p>
			<div class="notes" style="float:right">
				<h4>Interacting With Objects Around You</h4>
				<p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p>
				<ul style="margin-top:-1em;">
					<li>draw or sheathe a sword</li>
					<li>open or close a door</li>
					<li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li>
					<li>pick up a dropped axe</li>
					<li>take a bauble from a table</li>
					<li>remove a ring fram your finger</li>
					<li>stuff some food into your mouth</li>
					<li>plant a banner in the ground</li>
					<li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li>
					<li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li>
					<li>throw a lever or a switch</li>
					<li>pull a torch from a sconce</li>
					<li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li>
					<li>extinguish a small flame</li>
					<li>don a mask</li>
					<li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li>
					<li>put your ear to a door</li>
					<li>kick a small stone</li>
					<li>turn a key in a lock</li>
					<li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li>
					<li>hand an item to another character</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h4>Other Activity on Your Turn</h4>
			<p>
				Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move. You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
				<b>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free</b>, during either your move or your action. For example. you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a
				foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects
				always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an
				action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
			</p>
			<h4>Simultaneous Effects</h4>
			<p>
				Most effects in the game happen in succession, following an order set by the rules or the DM. Though in certain cases, effects can happen at the same time, especially at the start or end of your turn.
				If two or more things happen at the same time on your turn, you decide the order in which those things happen. If multiple things happen at the end of a monster's or NPC's turn, the DM decides the
				order.
			</p>
			<h2 id="movement">Movement & Position</h2>
			<p>
				In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. Your speed—sometimes called
				your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here. Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and
				swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your
				speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.
			</p>
			<h4>Breaking Up your move</h4>
			<p>
				You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move
				20 feet. Furthermore, if you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make
				two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/8/4/8407b02f-66b3-4cfa-a3c4-105f314fd037.jpg">
			<p>
				If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've
				already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less. you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a speed
				of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Fly"><i>Fly</i></a> spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet
				more.
			</p>
			<h4>Difficult Terrain</h4>
			<p>
				Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain. Every
				foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and
				shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.
			</p>
			<h4>Being Prone</h4>
			<p>
				Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are <a href="?f=Prone"><b>prone</b></a>. You can
				drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For  example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15
				feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0. To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of
				movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
			</p>
			<h4>Moving Around Other Creatures</h4>
			<p>
				You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that
				another creature's space is difficult terrain for you. Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space. If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your
				move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained on the "Attacks" tab.

			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Space</b><br>
				Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Creature Size</b><br>
				A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does
				control a space that wide. If a Medium <a href="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Hobgoblin"><b>hobgoblin</b></a> stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.
				A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effeetively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
				combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a
				Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
			</p>
			<h2 id="gridplay">Playing on a Grid</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">Y</span>ou can play out combat on a grid of squares or hexes, using miniatures or other tokens. If you do, follow these rules:<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Spaces and your Speed</b><br>
				Each space on the grid, whether square or hex, represents 5 feet. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is
				particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing
				your speed in squares on your character sheet.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Entering a Space</b><br>
				To enter a space, you must have at least 1 space of movement left. If a space costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it.
				For example, you must have at least 2 spaces of movement left to enter a space of difficult terrain.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Diagonal Movement</b><br>
				On a square grid, you can move to spaces that are diagonally adjacent to the square you're in, unless that move crosses the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.
				For the sake of easy play, your DM might allow this to cost no extra movement, but if you want your movement to be more geometraically accurate and realistic, use the following rules:<br>
				When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 1 space, but the second diagonal square counts as 2 spaces. This pattern of 1 and then 2 spaces continues
				whenever you're counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then
				three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Areas of Effect</b><br>
				The area of effect of a spell, monster ability, or other feature must be translated onto squares or hexes to determine which potential targets are in the area and which aren't. Choose the corner of
				a space as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow its rules as normal. If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a space, it affects that space.<br><br>
			</p>

			</table>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Line of Sight</b><br>
				To precisely determine whether there is line of sight between two spaces, pick a corner of one space and trace an imaginary line from that corner to any part of another space. If at least one such
				line doesn't pass through or touch an object or effect that blocks vision—such as a stone wall, a thick curtain, or a dense cloud of fog—then there is line of sight.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Creature Size on Squares and Hexes</b><br>
				A creature's size determines how much space it occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different
				from what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster as its official size for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a Large base to represent a Huge giant. That
				giant takes up less space on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.
			</p>

			<h4 style="margin-top:0.5em;">Optional Rule: Flanking</h4>
			<p>
				Flanking gives combatants a simple way to gain advantage on attack rolls against a common enemy. When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or
				corners of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy. A creature can't flank an enemy that it can't see. A creature also can't
				flank while it is incapacitated. A Large or larger creature is flanking as long as at least one square or hex of its space qualifies for flanking.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Flanking on Squares</b><br>
				When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite
				sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Flanking on Hexes</b><br>
				On hexes, count around the enemy from one creature to its ally. Against a Medium or smaller creature, the allies flank if there are 2 hexes between them. Against a Large creature, the allies flank if
				there are exactly 4 hexes between them in any direction. Against a Huge creature, they must have exactly 5 hexes between them. Against a Gargantuan creature, they must have at least 6 hexes between
				them.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" style="float:none; display:inline-block; margin-top:-0.5em; margin-bottom:1em;" src="../Stylefiles/otherimg/flankingsquares.JPG">
			<img loading="lazy" style="float:none; display:inline-block; margin-top:-0.5em; margin-bottom:1em;" src="../Stylefiles/otherimg/flankinghex.JPG">
			<h4 style="margin-top:0.5em;">Optional Rule: Facing</h4>
			<p>
				If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the
				direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.
			</p>
			<p>
				A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.
				Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from
				the front and left arcs. Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=OchreJelly"><b>ochre jelly</b></a> could treat
				all of its arcs as front ones, while a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?s=Hydra"><b>hydra</b></a> might have three front arcs and one rear one.
			</p>
			<p>
				On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite
				side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.
			</p>
			<p>
				On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on
				the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.
			</p>
			<p>
				A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split
				exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/69279219.jpg">
			<h2 id="cover">Cover</h2>
			<p>
				Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benetit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on
				the opposite side of the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together.
				For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives threequarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
			</p>
			<p>
				A target with <b>half cover</b> has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large
				piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.
			</p>
			<p>
				A target with <b>three-quarters cover</b> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle
				might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
			</p>
			<p>
				A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is
				completely concealed by an obstacle.
			</p> 
			<h4>Cover on a Grid</h4>
			<p>
				To determine whether a target has cover against an attack or other effect on a grid, choose a corner of the attacker's space or the point of origin of an area of effect. Then trace imaginary lines
				from that corner to every corner of any one square the target occupies. If one or two of those lines are blocked by an obstacle (including another creature), the target has half cover. If three or
				four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit), the target has three-quarters cover.
			</p>
			<p>
				On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing lines between the corners of the hexagons. The target has half cover if up to three lines are blocked by an obstacle, and three-quarters cover if
				four or more lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target.

			<h1 id="attacksanddamage">Making an Attack</h1>
			<p>
				Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Choose a target.</b> Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li>
				<li><b>Determine modifiers.</b> The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities. and other
					effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li>
				<li><b>Resolve the attack.</b> You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or
					instead of damage.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.
			</p>
			<h4>Attack Rolls</h4>
			<p>
				When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers
				equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined by its dexterity modifier, the armor it is wearing, and a myriad of other possible modifiers,
				whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Rolling 1 or 20</b><br>
				You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.
			</p>
			<h4>Modifiers to the Roll</h4>
			<p>
				Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.
				In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained further down on this page. If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Ability Modifier</b><br>
				The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this
				rule. See <a href="./items.html?l=WeaponProperties">"Weapon Properties" on the Items page</a> if you're in doubt about what category your weapon falls under. Some spells also require an attack roll.
				The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, which is noted under the feature that allows the creature to cast the spell.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Proficiency Bonus</b><br>
				You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.
			</p>
			<h4 id="UnseenAttackers">Unseen Attackers and Targets</h4>
			<p>
				Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the <a href="./spells.html?l=Invisibility"><i>Invisibility</i></a> spell, or lurking in darkness. When you attack a target that
				you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in
				the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly. When a creature can't see you, you
				have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.
			</p>
			<img class="monimg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/3/5/35a30091-7f68-4a67-b47e-f44318fc93b2.jpg">
			<h2 id="meleeatks">Melee Attacks</h2>
			<p>
				Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster
				makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack. Most creatures have a 5-foot <b>reach</b> and can
				thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their
				descriptions.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also make an <b>unarmed strike</b> in melee: a punch, a kick, a headbutt, or similar forceful blow. Whatever the form of unarmed strike, you use your body as a simple melee weapon in the
				process.
			</p>
			<h4>Opportunity Attacks</h4>
			<p>
				In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.
				You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the
				provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach. You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the
				Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't
				provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
			</p>
			<p>
				A creature also provokes an opportunity attack if it enters the reach of another creature, that is not on difficult terrain, from difficult terrain.
			</p>
			<h4>Two-Weapon Fighting (Dual Wielding)</h4>
			<p>
				If you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action on that turn to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're
				holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,
				instead of making a melee attack with it.
			</p>
			<h4 id="GrapplingaCreature">Grappling a creature</h4>
			<p>
				When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this
				attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by
				making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject
				the target to the <a href="?f=Grappled">grappled condition</a>. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Escaping a Grapple</b><br>
				A grappled creature can use its action to attempt to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Moving a Grappled Creature</b><br>
				When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
			</p>
			<h4>Shoving a Creature</h4>
			<p>
				Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action,
				this attack replaces one of them. The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the
				target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also use this special attack to force a target to the side, rather than away. You have disadvantage on on your Strength (Athletics) check if you do so. If that check is successful, you move
				the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.
			</p>
			<h4>Disarm</h4>
			<p>
				Using the attack action, you can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one
				of them. Make an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you win the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the
				defender drops the item. You have disadvantage on the attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than you, or
				disadvantage if it is smaller.
			</p>
			<h4>Optional Rule: Cleaving through Creatures</h4>
			<p>
				If the party regularly fight hordes of lower level monsters, the DM can speed up such fights using this rule:<br>
				When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach
				and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the
				remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" class="monimg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/6/d/6ddc6b73-298b-4afa-990a-63706e77dd9f.jpg">
			<h2 id="rangedatks">Ranged Attacks</h2>
			<p>
				When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also
				involve making a ranged attack.
			</p>
			<h4>Range</h4>
			<p>
				You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some
				ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage
				when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.
			</p>
			<h4>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4>
			<p>
				Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are
				within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.
			</p>
			<h2 id="dmgncrit">Damage and Critical Hits</h2>
			<p>
				Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&amp;D. The thrust of a sword. a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.
			</p>
			<h4>Hit Points</h4>
			<p>
				Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more
				fragile. A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage
				or receives healing. Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0
				hit points.
			</p>
			<h4>Damage Rolls</h4>
			<p>
				Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special
				abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0, but never negative, damage. When attacking with a <b>weapon</b>, you add your ability
				modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll to the damage. A <b>spell</b> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage in
				an <a href="?f=AreaofEffect">Area of Effect</a>, roll the damage only once, then apply that damage to all affected creatures in the area. For example, when a wizard casts
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a>, the same 8d6 worth of damage is dealt to all creatures caught in the blast.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Describing the Effects of Damage</b><br>
				Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half
				your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply
				knocks you unconscious.
			</p>
			<h4>Critical Hits</h4>
			<p>
				When you scroll a critical hit, your attack deals double damage, meaning the total of the weapon or spell's damage roll, any modifiers, as well as any additional damage dice rolled, such as those of
				the rouge's Sneak Attack feature. If the attack deals multiple types of damage (see below) such as through the <a hfer="./spells.html?l=SearingSmite"><i>Searing Smite</i> spell, double the damage
				types separately.
			</p>
			<h4>Damage Types</h4>
			<p>
				Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.
				The damage types follow, with examples to help a DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Acid:</b> The corrosive spray of a <a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Black Dragon"><b>black dragon's</b></a> breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a
					<a hfer="../dg/monsters.html?l=BlackPudding"><b>black pudding</b></a> deal acid damage.</li>
				<li><b>Bludgeoning:</b> Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.</li>
				<li><b>Cold:</b> The infernal chill radiating from an <a hfer="../dg/monsters.html?l=IceDevil"><b>ice devil's</b></a> spear and the frigid blast of a
					<a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=White Dragon"><b>white dragon's</b></a> breath deal cold damage.</li>
				<li><b>Fire:</b> <a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Red Dragon"><b>Red dragons</b></a> breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage,</li>
				<li><b>Force:</b> Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including <a hfer=".spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>
					and <a hfer="./spells.html?l=SpiritualWeapon"><i>Spiritual Weapon</i></a>.</li>
				<li><b>Lightning:</b> Lightning damage is caused by electrical shocks such as the <a href="./spells.html?l=LightningBolt"><i>Lightning Bolt</i></a> spell and the breath attack of a
					<a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Blue Dragon"><b>blue dragon</b></a>.</li>
				<li><b>Necrotic:</b> Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as <a href="./spells.html?l=ChillTouch"><i>Chill Touch</i></a>, withers matter and even the soul.</li>
				<li><b>Piercing:</b> Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.</li>
				<li><b>Poison:</b> Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a <a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Green Dragon"><b>green dragon's</b></a> breath deal poison damage.</li>
				<li><b>Psychic:</b> Mental abilities such as a <a hfer="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Mind Flayer"><b>mind flayer's</b></a> psionic blast deal psychic damage.</li>
				<li><b>Radiant:</b> Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's <a href="./spells.html?l=FlameStrike"><i>Flame Strike</i> spell or an <a hfer="../dg/monsters.html?s=Angel"><b>angel's</b></a> smiting weapon,
					sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</li>
				<li><b>Slashing:</b> Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.</li>
				<li><b>Thunder:</b> A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the <a href="./spells.html?l=Thunderwave"><i>Thunderwave</i></a> spell, deals thunder damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h4>
			<p>
				Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has <b>resistance</b> to a damage type, damage of that type is
				halved against it. If a creature or an object has <b>vulnerability</b> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

				Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning
				damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance
				or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a
				nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
			</p>
			<h4>Variant: Massive Damage</h4>
			<p>
				When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a
				roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

			<img loading="lazy" class="monimg" style="margin-top:-1em;" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/0/f/0ff82aba-9022-4eff-a6dc-67365360d646.jpg">
			<p>
				Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a
				<a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> spell or a
				<a href="./items.html?s=Potion of Healing"><i><span class="comnmagit">Poti</span><span class="uncmmagit">ons o</span><span class="raremagit">f Hea</span><span class="vryrmagit">ling</span></i></a> can
				remove damage in an instant. When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any
				hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the
				ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8. A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the <a href="./spells.html?l=Revivify"><i>Revivify</i></a> spell has restored
				it to life.
			</p>
			<h4>Temporary Hit Points</h4>
			<p>
				Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points: they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
				injury. When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5
				temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.
				Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new
				ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you
				to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points
				has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
			</p>
			<h2 id="stopdying">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">W</span>hen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
			</p>
			<h4>Instant Death</h4>
			<p>
				Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a
				cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her
				hit point maximum, the cleric dies.
			</p>
			<h4>Falling Unconscious</h4>
			<p>
				If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall <a href="?f=Unconscious">unconscious</a>. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Knocking a Creature Out</b><br>
				Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out.
				The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" class="monimg" style="width:34.5%" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/85763457.jpg">
			<h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>
			<p>
				Whenever you start your tum with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving
				throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll
				is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success. you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and
				failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Rolling 1 or 20</b><br>
				When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Damage at 0 Hit Points</b><br>
				If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a criticai hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your
				hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
			</p>
			<h4>Stabilizing a Creature</h4>
			<p>
				The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw. You can use
				your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A stable creature doesn't make death saving
				throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature
				that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
			</p>
			<h4>Optional Rule: Injuries</h4>
			<p>
				Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries. It's up to the DM to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a
				lingering injury under the following circumstances:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When it takes a critical hit</li>
				<li>When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright</li>
				<li>When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">T</span>o determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for
				creatures with different body types.

			<!--The flavour text on the card references a man but the person in the art is a woman, so I corrected it-->
			<p>
				Magic permeates the worlds of D&amp;D and most often appears in the form of a spell. A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a
				specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them
				vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds. Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal
				damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and
				monsters use spells in unique ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient
				ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.
			</p>
			<h4>The Weave and the Sources of Magic</h4>
			<p>
				The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in
				the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.
				Mortals can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the
				world of Faerûn call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is
				locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to
				blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, bards, and artificers are commonly called arcane magic.
				These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and
				arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called divine magic. These spellcasters' access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the
				divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath. Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When
				characters use divination spells such as <a href="./spells.html?l=DetectMagic"><i>Detect Magic</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such
				as <a href="./spells.html?l=DispelMagic"><i>Dispel Magic</i></a> smooths the Weave. Spells such as <a href="./spells.html?l=AntimagicField"><i>Antimagic Field</i></a> rearrange the Weave so that
				magic flows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.
			</p>
			<h4>The Schools of Magic</h4>
			<p>
				Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially
				the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Abjuration</b> spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other
				planes of existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Conjuration</b> spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the
				caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Divination</b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant
				people or places.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Enchantment</b> spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action,
				or even control another creature like a puppet.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Evocation</b> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Illusion</b> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that
				never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Necromancy</b> spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create undead, or even bring
				the dead back to life. Creating undead through the use of necromancy spells such as <a href="./spells.html?l=AnimateDead"><i>Animate Dead</i></a> is considered an evil act in most cultures, and
				casters who make frequent use of such spells are ostracized more often than not.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Transmutation</b> spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the
				caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.
			</p>
			<h4>Known and Prepared Spells</h4>
			<p>
				Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a
				limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing
				spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions. In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's
				level, as shown on their class table, or on the <a href="./charactercreation.html?l=MulticlassedSpellcasters">spellcaster level table</a> if they're multiclassed.
			</p>
			<h4>Spell Level</h4>
			<p>
				Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>
				at 1st level and the earth-shaking <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell's
				level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell. Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17<sup>th</sup> level, not
				9<sup>th</sup> level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Cantrips</b><br>
				A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with
				the magic needed to produce the effect over and over.
			</p>
			<h4>Spell Slots</h4>
			<p>
				Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple
				spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell
				slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Yaromir has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a character casts a spell, they expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for
				a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Yaromir casts
				<a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>, a 1st-level spell, he spends one of his four 1st-level slots and has three remaining. Finishing a long rest restores any expended
				spell slots.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain
				eldritch invocations, and a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=PitFiend"><b>pit fiend</b></a> from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.<br><br>
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" style="width:40%;" src="../Stylefiles/otherimg/hubert.png">
			<p id="hocuspocus">
				<b class="noindent">Upcasting: Casting a Spell at a Higher Level</b><br>
				When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Yaromir casts
				<a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a> using one of his 2nd-level slots, that <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a> is 2nd level. Effectively, the
				spell expands to fill the slot it is put into. Some spells, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>,
				have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.
			</p>
			<h2>Casting a Spell</h2>
			<p>
				When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects. Each spell block on the Spell Lists page includes the following
				information in some way before describing the actual effects of the spell: the spell's name, level (sorted by on the page), school of magic (color coded), casting time, range, components, and
				duration.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Casting in Armor</b><br>
				Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically
				hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
			</p>
			<h4>Saving Throws</h4>
			<p>
				Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success
				or failure. The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.
			</p>
			<h4>Spell Attack Rolls</h4>
			<p>
				Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier
				+ your proficiency bonus. Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that
				can see you and that isn't incapacitated.
			</p>
			<h4 id="CastingTime">Casting Time</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">M</span>ost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Bonus Action</b><br>
				A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You can't use your regular action to cast another spell during the same turn you cast a spell with a cast time of 1 bonus action, except for a
				cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. (You can still cast spells using additional actions, unless the source of those actions says otherwise, such as the
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Haste"><i>Haste</i></a> spell.)<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Reactions</b><br>
				Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells
				you exactly when you can do so.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Longer Casting Time</b><br>
				Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend
				your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so <a href="?f=Concentration">(see "Concentration" below)</a>. If your concentration is broken, the
				spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p id="RitualCasting">
				<b class="noindent">Rituals</b><br>
				Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes
				longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level. To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a
				feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on their list of spells known, unless the
				character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.
			</p>
			<h4>Range</h4>
			<p>
				The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>, the target is a creature. For a spell like
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts. Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a
				creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells. such as the <a href="./spells.html?l=Shield"><i>Shield</i></a> spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self. Spells that create
				cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you <a href="?f=AreaofEffect">(see "Areas of Effect")</a>.
				Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.
			</p>
			<h4 id="Components">Components</h4>
			<p>
				A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If
				you can't provide one or more of a spell's components—for example if you cannot speak or have lost your spellcasting focus—you are unable to cast the spell. <br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Verbal (V)</b><br>
				Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets
				the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the <a href="./spells.html?l=Silence"><i>Silence</i></a> spell, can't cast a spell
				with a verbal component.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Somatic (S)</b><br>
				Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform
				these gestures.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Material (M)</b><br>
				Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a <a href="./items.html?l=adventuringgear">component pouch or a spellcasting
				focus</a> in place of the components specified for a spell, unless that component has a listed monetary cost, in which case a character must have that specific component before they can cast the
				spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that they use to perform somatic components. If a spell states that a material component is
				consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

			<h4>Duration</h4>
			<p>
				A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are
				dispelled or destroyed.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Instantaneous</b><br>
				Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p id="Concentration">
				<b class="noindent">Concentration</b><br>
				Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentralion, that fact
				is noted to the right of its name on the spell list and clarified in its Duration entry, which also specifics how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action
				required). Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Casting another spell that requires concentration.</b> You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once</li>
				<li><b>Taking damage.</b> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the
					damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>
				<li><b>Being incapacitated or killed.</b> You lose concentration on a spell if you are <a href="?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a> or if you die.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">T</span>he DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC10
				Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Combining Magical Effects</b><br>
				The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent
				effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast <a href="./spells.html?l=Bless"><i>Bless</i></a> on the same target, that
				character gains the spell's benefit only once; they don't get to roll two bonus dice
			</p>
			<h4>Targets</h4>
			<p>
				A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an
				area of effect (described below). Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more
				subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">A Clear Path to the Target</b><br>
				To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction. such as a wall, is between
				you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Targeting Yourself</b><br>
				If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you
				cast, you can target yourself.
			</p>
			<img loading="lazy" src="../stylefiles/otherimg/spelleffects.png">
			<h4 id="AreaofEffect">Areas of Effect</h4>
			<p>
				Spells such as <a href="./spells.html?l=BurningHands"><i>Burning Hands</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=ConeofCold"><i>Cone of Cold</i></a> cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple
				creatures at once. A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of
				origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The roles for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have
				an area whose origin is a creature or an object.
			</p>
			<p>
				A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't
				included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide <a href="?l=cover">total cover</a>.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Line</b><br>
				A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless the
				caster decides otherwise.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Cone</b><br>
				A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect
				specities its maximum length. A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless the caster decides otherwise.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Cube</b><br>
				You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's
				area of effect, unless the caster decides otherwise.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Sphere</b><br>
				You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. A sphere's point of origin is
				included in the sphere's area of effect.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Cylinder</b><br>
				A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The
				energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from
				the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder. A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.<br><br>
			</p>

		<div class="container"> <!-- additional rules-->
			<h2 id="savingthrows">Saving Throws</h2>
			<p>
				A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make
				one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational
				bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in
				Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add their proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have
				saving throw proficiencies as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and
				proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced
				harm, from an effect.
			</p>
			<h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>
			<p>
				Conditions alter a creature's abilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are
				impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration
				specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't
				get worse, A creature either has a condition or doesn't. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

			<h2 id="mountedcmbt">Mounted Combat</h2>
			<img loading="lazy" style="margin-top:-2em;" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/c/0/c021868f-9ab8-4a52-b12e-3cc35c9d67f0.jpg">
			<p>
				Not all fighting is done with feet planted firmly on the ground, and the most common reason is because a creature is mounted or traveling on some kind of vehicle. Here are some rules for such
				situations.
			</p>
			<h4>Mounted Combat</h4>
			<p>
				A knight charging into battle on a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Warhorse"><b>warhorse</b></a>, a wizard casting spells from the back of a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Griffin"><b>griffin</b></a>, or
				a cleric soaring through the sky on a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Pegasus"><b>pegasus</b></a> all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide. A willing creature that is at
				least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
			</p>
			<h4>Mounting and Dismounting</h4>
			<p>
				Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you
				must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing <a href="?f=Prone">prone</a> in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're
				knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw. If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are
				dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.
			</p>
			<h4>Controlling a Mount</h4>
			<p>
				While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. You can control a mount only
				if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated <a href="../dg/monsters.html?s=Horse"><b>horses, donkeys, and similar creatures</b></a> are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a
				controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options; Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on
				the turn that you mount it.
			</p>
			<p>
				An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat,
				rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes. In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the
				mount.
			</p>
			<h4>Piloting a Chariot</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">C</span>hariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, but with the following differences:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.</li>
				<li>Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.</li>
				<li>A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.</li>
				<li>If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="shipcombt">Ships in Combat</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">W</span>hether sailing to war or hunting notorious pirates, ships make deadly weapons and dramatic battlefields. This section provides guidance on using ships in combat.
			</p>
			<h4>The Ship's Turn</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">A</span> ship rolls initiative using its Dexterity, and it uses its crew's quality score as a modifier to that roll.
			</p>
			<p>
				The actions listed in <a href="./items.html?l=shipstats"><b>a ship's statblock</b></a> specify what the ship can do on its turn, using its special actions rather than the actions used by creatures.
				It even relies on its actions to move; it doesn't have a move otherwise. The ship's captain decides which actions to use. A given action can be chosen only once during a turn.
			</p>
			<p>
				A ship cannot simply stop dead in its tracks or move backwards. It is too heavy and hydrodynamic to do so. It has a momentum speed equal to the distance it traveled the turn before -5 feet. A ship
				that wishes to move less than its momentum speed must use its oars to slow the ship down by a number of feet up to the oars' movement speed. At the end of its turn, a ship that doesn't take its move
				action drifts straight ahead a number of feet equal to its momentum speed.
			</p>
			<h4>Special Officer Actions</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">D</span>uring an encounter, the captain, first mate, and bosun each have access to two special action options: Take Aim and Full Speed Ahead, both detailed below. 
			</p>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Full Speed Ahead</b><br>
				As an action while on deck, the captain, first mate, or bosun can exhort the crew to work harder and drive the ship forward faster. The officer rolls a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuation) check
				with a DC of 14 - the crew's quality score (see "Ships" on the Items page). On a success, the ship's oar speed is doubled until the end of its next turn. If the captain takes this action, the ship
				must move using its oars during its next turn.
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Take Aim</b><br>
				As an action, the captain. first mate, or bosun directs the crew's firing, aiding in aiming one of the ship's weapons. Select one of the ship's weapons that is within 10 feet of the officer. It gains
				advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship's next turn. If the captain takes this action, and the ship cant' take all it's actions, the ship must fire the aimed weapon as
				one of its actions on its next turn.
			</div>
			<h4>Crew in Combat</h4>
			<p>
				Managing a ship's entire crew in combat can prove cumbersome, especially as larger ships often host dozens of sailors. Typically the crew is too busy managing the ship to do anything else during
				combat. It is normally assumed that a ship's crew is evenly divided between the stations required to take the ship's actions. The DM can track the specific positions of crew members if they are so
				inclined however, and assume control of individual crew members if they do.
			</p>
			<p>
				Slaying a ship's crew reduces the number of actions most ships can take, making the crew a tempting target in combat. Individual attacks are resolved as normal. In the case of spells that cover an
				area, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=LightningBolt"><i>Lightning Bolt</i></a>, the DM decides how many sailors are affected depending on
				where the spell hits.

			</p>
			<h4>Crashing a Ship</h4>
			<table style="float:right;margin-top:-2em;"> 
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>Size</td>
						<td style="text-align:center;">Damage</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				If a ship moves into the space occupied by a creature or an object, the ship might crash. A ship avoids crashing if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it. When a ship crashes,
				it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes bludgeoning damage to its hull based on the size of the creature or object it crashed into, as shown on the
				table to the right. It also stops moving if lhe object or creature is one size smaller than it or larger. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object collided with moves to the
				nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the ship's path. At the DM's discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed.
			</p>
			<p>
				A creature struck by a ship must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 +the ship's Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship's size (as shown on the table to the right) on a
				failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
			</p>
			<h2 id="underwatercmbt">Underwater Combat</h2>
			<p>
				When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment.
				Underwater the following rules apply:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When making a <b>melee weapon attack</b>, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger,
					iklwa, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.</li>
				<li>A <b>ranged weapon attack</b> automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a
					crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).</li>
				<li>Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="chases">Chases</h2>
			<img loading="lazy" class="monimg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/d/d/dd73fa5a-be0f-49a4-a921-afefbc8fa9c5.jpg">
			<p>
				Strict application of the movement rules can turn a potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same speed
				never close the distance between each other. This set of rules can make chase more exciting by introducing random elements.
			</p>
			<h4>Beginning a Chase</h4>
			<p>
				A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on
				its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes. When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and
				designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.
			</p>
			<h4>Running the Chase</h4>
			<p>
				Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that does so
				is likely to be caught.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Dashing</b><br>
				During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to
				succeed on a DC10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion. A participant drops out of the chase if its exhaustion reaches level 5. A creature can remove the levels
				of exhaustion it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Spells and Attacks</b><br>
				A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks and spells. Chase participants can't
				normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the targets of opportunity
				attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke opportunity attacks from the thug.

			<p>
				A chase ends when one side or the other tops, when the quarry escapes, or when the pursuer are close enough to their quarry to catch it. If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a
				Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The result is compared to the passive wisdom (Perception) scores of the pursuers. If the
				quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check. If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of the quarry's check
				is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round. The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its check based on prevailing
				circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table on the right. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither, as usual.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability to escape, at the DM's discretion. For example, a quarry with a <a href="./spells.html?l=FaerieFire"><i>Faerie Fire</i></a> spell cast on it
				might have disadvantage on checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot. Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban setting, escape
				might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to where it went.
			</p>
			<h4>Chase Complications</h4>
			<p>
				As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase Complications table provide several examples.
				Complications occur randomly. Each participant in the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the
				next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to
				negate the complication. Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers (for example, casting the <a href="./spells.html?l=Web"><i>Web</i></a> spell in a narrow alleyway). The
				DM Adjudicates these as they see fit.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Designing Your Own Chase Tables</b><br>
				The tables presented here don't work for all possible environments. A chase through the sewers of Baldur's Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create
				your own table.

				<b class="noindent">Splitting Up</b><br>
				Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller
				chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separate group.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">Role Reversal</b><br>
				During a chase, it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention from other members of the thieves'
				guild. As they pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing
				thief might run into the waiting arms of his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the thieves in pursuit.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b class="noindent">For the DM: Mapping the Chase</b><br>
				If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that require the characters to make
				ability checks or saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random table of complications similar to the ones in this section. Otherwise, improvise as you play.
			</p>
			<p>
				Complications can be barriers to progress or opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by bugbears might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the nest or
				throw rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers. A map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have
				few (if any) branches, while a sewer chase might have several.
			</p>
			<h2 id="morale">Optional Rule: Morale</h2>
			<img loading="lazy" class="monimg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/8/4/84f2c8f5-8e11-4639-b7de-00e4a2cbabee.jpg">
			<p>
				Some combatants might run away when a fight turns against them. This optional rule helps determine when monsters and NPCs flee. A creature might flee under any of the following circumstances:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creature is surprised.</li>
				<li>The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer for the first time in the battle.</li>
				<li>The creature has no way to harm the opposing side on its turn.</li>
			</ul><br><br>
			<p class="noindent">
				A group of creatures might flee under any of the following circumstances:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All the creatures in the group are surprised.</li>
				<li>The group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, incapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle.</li>
				<li>The group is reduced to half its original size with no losses on the opposing side.</li>
			</ul><br><br>
			<p>
				To determine whether a creature or group of creatures flees, the DM makes a DC10 Wisdom saving throw for the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition is overwhelming, the saving throw is
				made with disadvantage, or the DM can decide that the save fails automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the group with the next
				highest Charisma score make the saving throw instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a failed save, the affected creature or group flees by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group that surrenders is attacked by
				its conquerors, the battle might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to flee or surrender will be made. A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' benefit. For example, an
				ogre that flees from combat might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder.
