				<h2>Aeri</h2>
				<p>
					The aeri are a people of caravaneers found troughout the lands west of the great steppe, traveling from town to town as merchants, actors, and musicians. Despite looking a lot like humans, aeri
					are descended from a race of lesser celestials who survived the fall of heaven. This celestial heritage manifests itself primarily in the aeri's hair and eyes, as well as in the magical
					abilities they all inherently possess. Aeric hair colors are always bright, ranging from brown to white, and has a metallic luster to it. Aeri with hair that appears to be made from actual gold or
					silver are not uncommon. Their eyes come in all colors of the rainbow and then some, and sparkle like gemstones in a way human eyes could only hope to.
				</p>
				<h4>Fallen from Heaven</h4>
				<p>
					According to their own traditions, the aeri's progenitors, the cherubs, were once the watchers of the world, ready to come down from the heavenly plane to defend it from any cosmic threat stemming
					from without or within. However, like all other forces of order and good, they were powerless to stop the rise of Arenquis and the destruction of Nendor. This demonstrated their weakness to the
					titans, who would spend the next few millennia trying to find a way to enter the cherub's realm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The titans were mysterious beings of primordial evil known to the cherubs only by their titles. Exactly how many there were is a matter of some debate among scholars and storytellers, but the
					general consensus is that they numbered somewhere between 9 and 12. Their ranks included such beings as <i>The Burning One</i>, <i>The Silent Claws</i>, and <i>The Eraser</i>, among others. Their
					wrath was terrible, and utterly destroyed the heavens. The few cherubs who survived were forever changed by the catastrophe, which came to be known as the fall of heaven. Prior to the fall, the
					cherubs had been winged and immortal, but friction from the fall burned their wings off, and the material world's lack of pervasive divine magic stripped them of their immortality. 
				</p>
				<h4>From the Ashes</h4>
				<p>
					Cast out into the world, suddenly stripped of their immortality, the cherubs found themselves drifting from place to place, always without purpose or a place to call home. However, in this dark
					time, they were gathered together by a wandering warrior named Airinos. This warrior had come across one of the fallen cherubs, a woman named Brianna, on his journeys, and resolved to pull her out
					of her despair by showing her the beauty he saw everywhere around him. He succeeded, and the two married, vowing to travel the world together for the rest of their lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the two taveled, news of their success and happiness reached other cherubs, and they were soon joined by many who wished to accompany them. Eventually the caravan grew too big, and split up.
					Many of the cherubs also took human partners who were drawn to the traveing lifestyle. Thus the celestial blood of the cherubs was diluted, and the aeri were born.
				</p>
				<h4>Aeric Religion</h4>
				<p>
					Aeri have no unified pantheon, instead typically choosing to adopt the gods of places they visit that appeal to them. Still, all of them pay respects to their founders—the wagon-parents—with some
					worshiping them as minor gods. According to aeric tradition, Airinos and Brianna are still out there in the world somewhere, forever traveling on their quest to see all the beautiful things the
					world has to offer.

				<h4 style="display:inline-block; width:48%">Airinos</h4>
				<h4 style="display:inline-block; width:48%; margin-left:1%">Brianna</h4>
				<p style="display:inline-block; width:48%">
					Airinos is a cheerful and curious soul, seeing the beauty in everything and good in everyone. He is an unparalleled swordsman, but he uses his great skill to spare those he has to fight, and will
					only kill if it is absolutely necessary. He teaches the aeri to be ever curious and to push forward into unknown territory. He also teaches them to share what they can with those in need,
					especially other travelers, and to never deny those who would travel with them. The last rule is absolute, even if said person has commited crimes against the caravan before. The aeri are under no
					compulsion to trust the individual, but they must always share the joy of travel and exploration with those who desire it. Airinos believes that everyone can be redeemed if they experience the joy
					of traveling and seeing the wonders of the world.
				</p>
				<p style="display:inline-block; width:48%; margin-left:1%; vertical-align:top;">
					Where Airinos is the driving force behind the aeri's journeys, Brianna is the loyalty and wisdom that keeps their caravans together. She teaches them to keep their wagons in good condition, to
					treat their draft animals well, and to trust and believe in their kin. She also teaches the aeri to not trust outsiders, and not let themselves be exploited. Aeri share with those in need, but are
					adamant about payment for their services, and are very protective about their secrets of music and swordplay. 
				</p>
				<h4>Artists and Merchants</h4>
				<p>
					Since they do not stay in one place for very long, aeri naturally don't practice agriculture, nor do they practice other arts that require a permanent residence, such as blacksmithing. Aside from
					the obligatory basic horse handling, wagon care, and wilderness survival—which is learned by everyone—aeri women learn to sow and knit, and men learn to cook. Most of them also learn to use a
					sword, and to play one or more instruments and how to sing. The aeric style of music is very distinct and typically very popular in the places they visit, causing aeri musicians to be in high
					demand for special events such as weddings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every caravan is also home to at least one merchant, although typically a lot more. Despite being encouraged by their wagon-parents to travel far and wide, a majority of aeri caravans follow
					relatively set routes and return to a given place with reliable frequency, which is typically a good business oppurtunity both for the craftsmen, hunters, and farmers of the visited town, and for
					the aeri merchants and musicians.
				</p>
				<h4>Sanctioned by the Empire</h4>
				<p>
					Airinos is acknowledged and worshipped as a god of roads in the empire, and aeri are regarded as fully human under imperial law.  Thus, aeri enjoy a unique position as the only non-human race to
					have full rights within the empire's borders—of course provided they swear fealty to the emperor and acknowledge him as the god above all, just as humans have to. All aeri who travel through the
					empire at some point at least pay lip service to the emperor, and some who travel their routes almost entirely within the empire even become full-blown loyalists—or as close to it as they can be
					while still traveling around in their wagons. On the other hand, many aeri outside of the empire are appalled by the idea, and some even believe the emperor to be an avatar of one of their old
					enemies; <i>The Burning One</i>.
				</p>
				<h4>Aeric Names</h4>
				<p>
					Aeri are usually named as their cherub ancestors were, but it is also very common for them to bear names after the regions they travel through. Go for a Jewish, Aramaic, or otherwise biblical
					name if you want the former.
				</p>

			<h2>Elf</h2>
			<p>
				The elves of dragonsea are an ancient people, the bringers of civilization and pioneers of spellcraft. Though once united, elven populations are mostly separate since the destruction of their ancient
				homeland of Nendor.<br>
				They are unrelated to the classical D&amp;D elves, being far less alien than those. This description is a stub, and will be expanded at some point when I feel like writing paragraph upon paragraph of
				lore. Until then, this is just basic info and stats.
			</p>
			<h4>Elves in Arkanos</h4>
			<p>
				As an elf in Arkanos you're one of a people in diaspora. Early Arkanian rulers tried to resettle the elves of Soriel around their land in an effort to integrate them, but because of the long lifespans
				of elves this didn't end up working out too well. Elves in current-day Arkanos live in small communities around the nation, grumbling over the excess of their mage overlords. As an elf in this
				enviroment you're likely to be viewed with some distrust by the Humans, but outright discrimination is rare, except for on the border with the empire. Your peers also generally distrust humans in
				kind, pointing to people such as the spellweaver and the emperor as examples of why humans will one day destroy the world. Also, given your lifespan, your grandparents or great grandparents would've
				been alive when Soriel was still the great enemy of Arkanos, which probably influenced you somehow.<br>
				Arkanian elves tend to be high elves. It's not impossible for the odd snow or gold elf to show up there, but they are faraway travelers and a rare sight indeed.
			</p>
			<h4>Elf Traits</h4>
				<p style="max-width:60%;">
					<span class="noindent">Y</span>our elf character has the following racial traits.<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age:</i></b> Elves age about half as fast as humans until they reach maturity at around age 35. After that their aging slows down significantly. An elf at 500 is roughly as
					physically aged as a human at 80<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Your size is Medium. Your specific height and build depends on your subrace, however, see below. Elf females are a little shorter than males on average,
					though the difference is less pronounced than in humans.<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weavesense:</i></b> You know the <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=DetectMagic"><i>Detect Magic</i></a> spell and can cast it once without using a spell slot. You can't do so
					again until you finish a short or long rest. Furthermore, when a spell takes effect anywhere within 30 feet of you, you immediately learn the spell's point of origin, level, and school of magic.<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages:</i></b> You can speak, read, and write your local dialect of Nendorian, and one additional language of your choice. Nendorian is the melodic ancient language of
					the elves. Its dialects are Negalian, Sorieli, Héri, and Sirlam. The dialects are mostly mutually intelligible, but some words and expressions are bound to cause confusion.<br>
					<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subrace:</i></b> The elven diaspora and holdout states have developed into a variety of subraces, spread out across the world.<br>
				</p>
				<div class="subrace"> <!-- subraces -->
					<p style="width:32%">
						<b style="font-size:110%;"><span class="noindent">High Elf</span></b><br>
						The high elves were the people of Soriel, the holdout state with the closest link and highest number of refugees from ancient Nendor. Soriel has since been destroyed, leaving the High Elves,
						once the most numerous of elvenkind, to live in minority communities in human lands. High elves tend to have ligher skin, comparable to that of mediterranean humans, and black, brown, or red
						hair, sometimes shifting towards a dark blue or olive brown.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> High elves are half a hand taller than humans on average, but are more lightly built.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cantrip:</i></b> You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heirs of Nendor:</i></b> If you would fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this trait a number of times
						equal to half your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language:</i></b> Your local dialect is Sorieli.<br>
					</p>
					<p style="width:32%">
						<b style="font-size:110%;"><span class="noindent">Snow Elf</span></b><br>
						The snow elf king is the leader of the great Negalian union to the north, and his people are usually the leaders whenever the peoples of Negal need to come together. Originally a refuge for
						dissenters and criminals, the snow elves are typically less arrogant and rowdier than other elves. Snow elves are pale, almost ghostly white, and their hair is rarely darker than a light
						brown.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Snow elves average about 2m. They are also fairly comparable to humans in build, on average only being slightly lighter.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead by Example:</i></b> You are a paragon, a leader of people, and your presence inspires others to follow. Whenever you make an attack roll against a creature, or
						force a creature to make a saving throw, your allies gain a +1 to attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legalistic Heritage:</i></b> You have proficiency in the history skill.<br>
						<b title="the DC for the allies is the DC against whatever frightened them in the first place, usually as per the Cause Fear spell"
						><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officer's Discipline:</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Whenever you succeed on a saving throw against being frightened, all
						allies within 60ft of you that are frightened can roll a saving throw against that condition, ending the effect on themselves on a success.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow Elf Resistances:</i></b> The endless war seasons have adapted their participants to the cold weather and spread it to their descendants. You have resistance to
						cold damage.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language:</i></b> Your local dialect is Negali.<br>
					</p>
					<p style="width:32%">
						<b style="font-size:110%;"><span class="noindent">Gold Elf</span></b><br>
						Gold elves aren't very well developed lorewise, but are from an empire in [WEST_AFRICA] that mines ridiculous amounts of gold and has a strict social hierarchy based on wether you are a human
						(slave), half-elf (citizen), or full on elf (Master). They call themselves the "Hére", Nendorian for "Masters". Gold elf skin ranges from a very dark nut brown to pitch black, and their hair
						has bright metallic colors, such as gold, silver, copper, or brass<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Gold elves are built like humans, but are taller, averaging 190cm.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving Face:</i></b> Gold elves must never show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check
						or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +3). You can use this trait a number of times equal to
						your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold Elf Proficiencies:</i></b> You have proficiency with the scimitar, whip, longbow, and net. You also gain proficency with one musical instrument or gaming set of
						your choice.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language:</i></b> Your local dialect is Héri.<br>
					</p>
					<p style="width:32%">
						<b style="font-size:110%;"><span class="noindent">Jungle Elf</span></b><br>
						Jungle elves are even less developed and unlikely to come up, since they are isolated from the rest of elvenkind by the uncrossable dragonsea. They live in jungles to avoid being exterminated
						by the dragons that rule that side of the world. Jungle elf skin is some shade of light-ish brown, and their hair is some kind of red or green.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Jungle elves are about as tall as humans, and more lightly built.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jungle Walker:</i></b> You can move through difficult terrain made out of plants without expending extra movement, and you gain a climbing speed of 20ft.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask of the Wild:</i></b> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, mist, and other natural phenomena.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jungle Elf Proficiencies:</i></b> You have proficiency with the shortsword, dagger, shortbow, and javelin. You also have proficency with the poisoner's kit.<br>
						<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language:</i></b> Your local dialect is Sirlam.<br>

			Fiendspawn are born underground in the vast empire of the Lich King, often to unwilling mothers, be that woman mortal or fiend. In general, they are part of an attempt by the Lich King to create super

			<h2>Kamro&#772;mä</h2>
			As a kamro&#772;mä you hail from Koma&#772;t, the black land (Basically ancient egypt). You are a kind of human with the ears, eyes, and tail of a cat. Your feline features are a result of a blessing
			bestowed upon your kamro&#772;mä or human parents by the regional goddess of childbirth and good harvests. This blessing also makes sure that you are one of at the very least two siblings, although often
			many more—children of blessed parents are always  born as twins or triplets. Your native culture is fairly collectivist and focused on the good of the society above the individual. (You are also legally
			considered as one with your twin or two triplet siblings. more on that at some point). Kamro&#772;mä skin tends to be dark brown, but the odd lighter shade from immigrant parents exists. Their body
			hair is soft like a cat's fur, and the hair on their head takes on feline colors and patterns, leading to quite colorful hair. Especially on women, who can display a calico pattern. Their eyes are
			green or yellow, with the occational rare blue.<br>
			In Arkanos, you are an outsider, but a welcome one, sure to not face discrimination unless it is from a wayward imperial zealot.<br><br>
			This description is a stub, and will be expanded at some point when I feel like writing paragraph upon paragraph of lore. Until then, this is just basic info and stats.<br><br>
			Note to self and maybe others: the black lady is a southern specimen. There are two kinds of catpeople in dragonsea, one nubian and one egyptian. As of yet, this is not reflected in the stats or the
			description.
			<h4>Kamro&#772;mä Traits</h4>
			<p style="max-width:60%;">
				<span class="noindent">Y</span>our kamro&#772;mä character has the following racial traits.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age:</i></b> Kamro&#772;mä age and die at the same rate humans do.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Kamro&#772;mä are built like humans, but slightly shorter than them on average. Your size is Medium.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkvision:</i></b> You have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat's luck:</i></b> When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. You
				can't use this reaction if you're prone or your speed is 0.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feline Athleticism:</i></b> You have advantage on any athletics or acrobatics check involved in climbing, jumping, or falling. If you have or gain a climbing speed, that speed
				is increased by 10ft. In addition, whenever you make a long or high jump, you can roll a d6 and add the number to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance
				costs movement as normal.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purring:</i></b> You have the ability to purr, which, in addition to communication, helps you relax and recover. When you roll either 1 or 2 on any Hit Die, you can immediately
				re-roll the die and take the new roll. In addition, you regain all your hit dice after a long rest.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages:</i></b> You can read, speak, and write Rong'koma&#772;t and one other language of your choice. Rong'koma&#772;t is a nasal language, spoken high in the mouth. You
				also feel a kinship with cats of all kinds (whether housecat, lion, or displacer beast) and can often tell what they're thinking just by looking at them, as well as easily commuicate your own intent
				to them.<br>

			<img loading="lazy" style="float:right;" src="../Stylefiles/raceimages/Yosri.png">
			<h2>Yosri</h2>
			Yosri are small, rabbit-like humanoids that live in the Mountains of the Moon. They follow a buddhist-like religion and live in big communal temples that sprawl as far beneath the surface as they do above
			it.<br>
			This description is a stub, and will be expanded at some point when I feel like writing paragraph upon paragraph of lore. Until then, this is just basic info and stats.
			<h4>Yosri Traits</h4>
			<p style="max-width:60%;">
				<span class="noindent">Y</span>our yosri character has the following racial traits.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age:</i></b> Yosri mature at 9 years old and live to about 60.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Yosri grow about 110cm tall—150 if you count their ears. Their tails are up to 60cm long, and the race averages 25kg. Your size is Small.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkvision:</i></b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
				light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yosri Proficiencies:</i></b> You are proficient with shortbows, scimitars, shortswords, and quarterstaves. You are also proficient in the religion skill.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural Leapers:</i></b> Your jump distance is doubled. You have advantage on all athletics or acrobatics checks that involve jumping or landing after a jump you made, and you
				take no fall damage until you've fallen more than 20ft.<br><!--those 20ft still count towards the distance fallen, so a yosri falling 30ft takes 3d6. might need to clarify that-->
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child of the Earth:</i></b> You know the <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=MoldEarth"><i>Mold Earth</i></a> cantrip. It has a range of touch for you. If you also know
				<a href="../pg/spells.html?l=MoldEarth"><i>Mold Earth</i></a> another way—for example through your class—its range becomes 30ft as normal.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious Discipline:</i></b> Yosri faith emphasizes heavily on introspection and refining yourself to attain a state of higher being, encouraging believers to spend time
				reflecting on mistakes and perfecting their craft. You can spend 10 minutes meditating to gain the benefits of a short rest. Once you do, you cannot use this trait again until you finish a long rest.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versatile Hands:</i></b> All Yosri are ambidextrous and can adopt unorthodox fighting styles, rapidly switching stances to get past an enemy's defenses or simply overwhelming
				them with a flurry of strikes. You learn one of the following fighting styles:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Way of the Bull:</i></b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</li>
					<li><b><i>Way of the Leopard:</i></b> When you are wielding only one light melee weapon, that weapon has the versatile property for you. If you wield that weapon with two hands, you roll one
						additional weapon damage die when determining its damage.</li>
					<li><b><i>Way of the Hawk:</i></b> After taking the attack action, you can make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon as a bonus action. You can draw the weapon as part of that attack. If you took
						the attack action using a ranged weapon you are proficient with, you can make an attack with that weapon as a bonus action instead.</li>
					<li><b><i>Way of the Bear:</i></b> When you roll damage for an attack that used your strength modifier, you can treat the result of any die roll as 3.</li>
					<li><b><i>Way of the Viper:</i></b> When are wielding a spear or a quarterstaff, that weapon gains the finesse property, and its damage die is 1d8. If you wield it with two hands, it also gains
						the reach property, and its damage die becomes 1d10 instead.</li>
				</ul>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages:</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Lhasa, a tonal and somewhat harsh language spoken almost exclusively by Yosri.<br>

			<img title="Furries are the baseline expectation from this" loading="lazy" style="float:right;" src="../Stylefiles/ohnomygrandslam.png">
			<h2>Other Ancestries</h2>
			<p>
				In addition to the proper races with defined ranges and cultures, the world of Dragonsea features a number of people born from unusual and perhaps forbidden unions. The human womb can incubate any
				seed, and so may bear a child by anything from a horse to a kraken, should a woman somehow find herself impregnated by such a creature. In fact, this is how the fiendspawn race first began.
				Occasionally, this can happen with a half-elf as well, and much more rarely with the other humanoid races.
				Furthermore, mortal children are sometimes born by immortal mothers, such as a dryad or a vampire who was impregnated by a mortal man.
			</p>
			<p>
				Children with such unusual heritages often have trouble fitting into their native societies, and might even be thrown out of them entirely if they are deemed too disturbing to look at or interact
				with. Those with less obvious features of their nonhuman parents face less such issues, and are often accepted, or at least tolerated, as they are.
			</p>
			<h4>Traits</h4>
			<p style="max-width:60%;">
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age:</i></b> Your character's growth rate and lifespan depends on your parents, being roughly the same as your most short-lived humanoid parent.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size:</i></b> Your size matches any of your humanoid parents.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed:</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet if you're medium, or 25 if you're small.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proficiencies:</i></b> You are proficient with any combination of three skills, artisan's tools, or weapons.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages:</i></b> You can speak, read, and write all languages spoken by both your parents, including special languages such as Orca.<br>
				<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancestral Traits:</i></b> You gain either:
				<ol style="margin-top:-0.8em;">
					<li>Two traits in any combination from any other race or subrace, but not one that alters your skills or ability scores.</li>
					<li>One trait from any other race or subrace as per the option above, and two from the Unusual Heritage Traits list below</li>
					<li>Three traits from the Unusual Heritage Traits list below.</li>
				</ol>
				This list of traits is extensive, but by no means comprehensive. You can make up almost any trait, but whether you can have it, and if it counts as two or three traits, is up to the DM. The
				<a href="../dg/mess.html?l=Mutations">Mutation Tables</a> can be a good source of inspiration.<br>
				For instance, I once made a slug-man with a powerful prehensile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radula">radula</a> by combining the "Chameleon-like tongue" (99) and "Lithophagic" (80)
				mutations from the Dr Drohlin's Minor Mutations table, and giving my character the ability to naturally attack with his radula in melee range for 1d4 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. The
				result being this natural weapon as my sole Ancestral Trait: "<i><b>Sticky Radula:</b></i> +(Strength modifier + proficiency bonus) to hit, reach 5ft, range 20ft, one target. <i>Hit:</i>
				1d4+1d6+(Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC11). A grappled target is pulled up to 20 feet towards me if it's medium or smaller, otherwise I am pulled up
				to 20ft towards it. This grapple ends if I attack another creature."
			</p>

					cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</li><!--The ability to deal Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing dmage is intentional. Wind could justify either one, for instance-->
