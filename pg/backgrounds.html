					<h2>Acolyte</h2>
				</summary>
				<img class="ygo" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/56588755.jpg">
				<p>
					You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods, you act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites
					and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
				</p>
				<p>
					Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
					childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult
					outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Insight, Religion<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> Two of your choice<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing
					15 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</h4>
				<p>
					As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free
					healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you
					(but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
				</p>
				<p>
					You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good
					terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home, While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance. provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you
					remain in good standing with your temple.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies
					affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

					Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways

					You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of

				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>

					Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life is like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive—or why
					they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the
					truth about an ancient empire's downfall.

					An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains—their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice
					archaeology travel to the far corners of the world to root through crumbled cities and lost dungeons, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the stories of monarchs and high priests, wars
					and cataclysms.

				<h4>Dust Digger</h4>

					Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of

				<h4>Feature: Historical Knowledge</h4>
				<p>
					When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were dwarves, elves, humans, yuan-ti, or some other known race. In
					addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of wizards,
					warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the
					wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of a treasure-hunting scoundrel.

				<h4>Feature: Echoes of Victory</h4>
				<p>
					You have attracted admiration among spectators, fellow athletes, and trainers in the region that hosted your past athletic victories. When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where you
					grew up, there is a 50 percent chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Between adventures, you might compete in athletic events sufficient enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" on the Other Rules page).
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Competition can forge strong bonds between teammates and rivals or ignite bitter feuds that burn outside the arena. Athletes often apply lessons from their training to their lives in general.

				<img class="mtg" src="../Stylefiles/otherimg/urigeller.JPG" title="the CIA really thought this guy was a magician">
				<p>
					You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read
					them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in
					short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment—nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust—can restore
					youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real dea!.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Deception, Sleight of Hand<br>

					signet ring of an imaginary duke). and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Favorite Scheme</h4>

					Every charlatan has an angle they use in preference to other schemes. Choose a favorite scam or roll on the table to the right.

				<h4>Feature: False Identity</h4>
				<p>
					You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including
					official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But
					their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

				<p>
					You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its first line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service
					to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces,
					and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community

				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Watcher's Eye</h4>
				<p>
					Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization,
					and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Use the tables for the soldier background as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch. Your bond is
					likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety.

				<p>
					The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth of their handiworks, and you have been trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored under a dwarf master of the
					craft, enduring long hours, and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily—some dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices,
					even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's
					favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> History, Insight<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One type of artisan's tools<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> Dwarvish, or one other of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a
					set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk</h4>
				<p>
					As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where dwarves dwell, and the
					individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Use the tables for the guild artisan background as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance,
					consider the words "guild" and "clan" to be interchangeable.) Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal
					might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship.

				<p>
					In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You may or may not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the
					circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring
					comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while
					serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.

				<h4>Feature: Court Functionary</h4>
				<p>
					Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom
					to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Legalese</h4>
				<p>
					Your experience with your local legal system has given you a firm knowledge of the ins and outs of that system. Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like <i>ex
					injuria jus non oritur</i> and <i>cogitationis poenam nemo patitur</i> to frighten people into thinking that it is. With common folks who don't know any better, you might be able to intimidate or
					deceive to get favors or special treatment.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Use the tables for the guild artisan background as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a courtier. The noble court or
					bureaucratic organization where you got your start is directly or indirectly associated with your bond (which could pertain to certain individuals in the group, such as your sponsor or mentor).
					Your ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization.

				<h4>Criminal Specialty</h4>
				<p>
					There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such

				<h4>Feature: Criminal Contact</h4>
				<p>
					You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances;
					specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Criminal: Spy</h4>
				<p>
					Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an
					officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor
					among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

					<h2>Dungeoneer</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Most world are littered with dungeons. Like all structures, someone has to design, build, and maintain these spaces, and it just so happens there is a sizable overlap in the skill sets needed
					for both types. The vaunted dungeoneer does the dirty work that others are not often willing to partake in. They do the thankless work behind the scenes, reloading dart traps and emptying pits,
					to name only two things. Theirs is the genius behind each trap and monster. Yet the knowledge of mechanics, construction, and design allow someone with this skill set to have a significant
					advantage when it comes to adventuring. Who better to know where a trap may lay hidden than one adept at placing such devices? For this reason, dungeoneers are highly desired in many circles as
					they make excellent practical allies.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Investigation, Sleight of Hand<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Two of carpenter's tools, mason's tools, smith's tools, tinker's tools, or woodcarver's tools<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> : A set of traveler's clothes, one each of the tool kits you chose to be proficient with, and a belt pouch containing 10gp.
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Dungeoneering</h4>
				<p>
					You have ample experience in planning and placing devices of suffering in spaces of torment. You have advantage on skill checks made to notice or discern how to disarm traps. You can also 
					perfectly recall the layout and physical details of any dungeon you have been inside within the last 6 months.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Like all good architects, those with a dungeoneering background tend to be passionate about their art while retaining a sense of practicality. They appreciate fine artistry but look at problems
					from a pragmatic perspective. Much akin to mages, it is easy for dungeoneers to get lost in their work. Each detail calls to them on an intimate level and it is easy to lose the forest for the
					trees.

					You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear you, awakening grief or joy, laughter
					or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.

				<h4>Feature: By Popular Demand</h4>
				<p>
					You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a
					modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When
					strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Entertainer: Gladiator</h4>
				<p>
					A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer
					routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for
					entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident
					or net.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience's attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They're inclined toward the romantic and often
					cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.

					You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few,
					might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

					You are an operative of some faction or another—be that faction a guild, a noble house, or a state. The nature of your work depends on your specialty, but it is ultimately towards one goal: the
					furthering of your faction's interests. As an adventurer, you could be a field agent gathering treasure for the faction, an infiltrator gathering information or undermining the enemies of your
					faction, a diplomat dispatched to strike some form of deal, or an agent dispatched to help a power that is friendly to your faction. Perhaps you're a little of all four. Regardless of your work,
					your affiliation with your faction gives you access to a network of informants and allies to call upon in times of need.

					<b>Equipment:</b> Badge or emblem of your faction, a set of common clothes, one set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, and a purse containing 15gp.
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Faction Network</h4>
				<p>
					As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. When the faction assigns you a mission, it will usually provide
					you with the necessary supplies and transportation. Beyond this, you know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify covert operatives of your faction. Allies of your faction can
					provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities if
					they are undercover.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Secret Identity</h4>
				<p>
					You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of another faction. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow
					you to assume that persona and fit into the faction you're infiltrating. Consider why you're doing this infiltration work. Create a story on your own or use the table below to find a reason that
					suits you.

					Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a

				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to

				<p>
					You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and
					wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own
					right.

					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Insight, Persuasion<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One type of artisan's tools<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> One of your choice<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Guild Business</h4>
				<p>
					Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a
					different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools), as well as the principies
					of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.

				<h4>Feature: Guild Membership</h4>
				<p>
					As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and
					pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies,
					or hirelings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also
					gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. You
					must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Supply Chain</h4>
				<p>
					From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Guild Artisan: Guild Merchant</h4>
				<p>
					Instead of an artisans' guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others
					(or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one
					place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure
					far more than the life of an artisan.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Guild Artisan: Failed Merchant</h4>
				<p>
					Maybe you come from a long line of merchants. Perhaps you were an entrepreneur. Regardless, your ventures ended poorly. Whether it was because of outside influences, bad luck, or simply because
					your business acumen was weak, you lost everything. With failure, however. comes experience. You're free of that old life, having made some connections and learned your lessons. Prepared to
					pursue the life of an adventurer, your insight into the world of commerce migth just be the advantage you need to really stand out. If your character is a failed merchant, they have the Supply
					Chain feature instead of the Guild Membership feature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prosperous or failed, merchants start with the following equipment:<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> One set of artisan's tools, a letter of introduction from your guild, merchant's scale, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.<br>
					Failed merchants don't start with a letter of introduction, however.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of
					community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness. Failed Merchants use a different set of traits, see below.

				<h4>Failed Merchant Suggested Features</h4>
				<p>
					Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for
					knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger
					stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?

					You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You've tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can't be slain with a
					sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its
					toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.

					Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may
					be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the table below.

				<h4>Feature: Heart of Darkness</h4>
				<p>
					Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do
					their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					You have learned to live with the terror that haunts you. You are a survivor, who can be very protective of those who bring light into your darkened life. The characteristics on the "Horror
					Characteristics" tables under the "Customizing a Background" tab are also a great fit for characters with this background.

				<p>
					You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet,
					solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for.
				</p>
				<p>
					This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the
					company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a
					charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.

				<h4>Feature: Discovery</h4>
				<p>
					The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great
					truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has
					long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the
					reason for your return to society. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their
					attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

				<h4>Feature: Inheritance</h4>
				<p>
					Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from among the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and

				</p>
				<p>
					The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for
					themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the
					object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at
					first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your in heritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep
					your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

				<h4>Feature: Knightly Regard</h4>
				<p>
					You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious
					communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help
					from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.
				</p>
				<p>
					This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight
					in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when they are being hunted unjustly.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Use the tables for the soldier background as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. Your bond almost
					always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.

					<h2>Manservant</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Every noble household of any sufficient standing will have a large staff of servants, cooks, attendants, and so forth. Unique among these positions are the manservants who act as a 
					combination cleaner, servant, and personal attendant. Manservants are dedicated to serving a single person in whatever way is required of them. While this may seem a one-directional affair, and
					in some cases it is just that, a manservant and their charge will often form a close bond of loyalty and protectiveness toward each other. What form this relationship takes varies greatly from
					case to case, but many manservants become akin to their charge's parent, closest confidant, or even lover. Usually in such relationships, the manservant will act as a personal bodyguard,
					especially if they're adventurers.
				</p>

					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Athletics, Insight<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One of either cobbler's tools or weaver's tools<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> One of your choice<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A set of upper society servant's clothes, a cleaning kit (feather duster, soap, and rag), and a belt pouch containing 2gp)
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Homebound</h4>
				<p>
					You are skilled at maneuvering through the complex social structure of a noble house. In particular you find your expertise allows you a certain amount of freedom by masquerading as part of the
					staff. While you are dressed in a manservant's uniform within a place dedicated to high society, those of noble standing automatically perceive you as unimportant until you take hostile action.
					During this time you have advantage on Stealth, Sleight of Hand, and Deception checks made to maintain your cover.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Manservants tend to be quiet, stalwart companions. First and foremost they are loyal to their charges and work tirelessly to look after them. These attributes can have downsides, however, as
					manservants often blind themselves to the misdeeds of their betters.

					<h2>Noble</h2>
				</summary>
				<img class="mtg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/d/c/dcb94950-3f3e-4876-84f8-d5e4d9cfecee.jpg">
				<p>
					You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat
					unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest,
					hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own-it's connected to an entire family, and whatever
					title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on
					you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other
					aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them? What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you
					feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel
					about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family? Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring?
					Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family? These details help establish your family and your title as
					features of the world of the campaign.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> History, Persuasion<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One type of gaming set or one musical instrument<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> One of your choice<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Position of Privilege</h4>
				<p>
					Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every
					effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Kept in Style</h4>
				<p>
					While you are anywhere where your house has influence, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls
					you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate to settle what you owe.
				</p>
				<p>
					This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain
					a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Retainers</h4>
				<p>
					You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane
					tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Noble: Knight</h4>
				<p>
					A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of
					Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining
					retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).
				</p>
				<p>
					As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in a chaste
					sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.)
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of
					bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way
					to undermine a noble.

				<h4>Feature: Researcher</h4>
				<p>
					When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library,
					scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot
					be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Library Access</h4>
				<p>
					Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the
					library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Sage: Cloistered Scholar</h4>
				<p>
					As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to a great institute of learning, where you were apprenticed and
					taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home—not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. If
					your career as a sage was primarily spent in a great center of learning, you can pick the Library Access feature instead of the Researcher feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right,
					sometimes as a means toward other ideals.

				<img class="mtg" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/a/9/a9b016d4-ddf6-47d6-b934-a0b979b60680.jpg">
				<p>
					You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is
					the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it
					widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands? What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the
					captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Athletics, Perception<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Navigator's tools, vehicles (water)<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A belaying pin (dub), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets
					table on the Items page), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Ship's Passage</h4>
				<p>
					When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations
					with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will
					determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Bad Reputation</h4>
				<p>
					No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at
					a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Sailor: Pirate</h4>
				<p>
					You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent
					more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town. If you decide that your sailing
					career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputalion feature instead of the Ship's Passage feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

				<p>
					War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the
					battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had
					during your mi!itary career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble's or merchant's private army, or a mercenary company.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Athletics, and one of Intimidation or Persuasion<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a banner), a gaming set of your choice, your old military uniform (traveler's
					clothes in quality), and a belt pouch containing the last of your wages (10 gp).
				</p>
				<h4>Specialty</h4>

					During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

				</table>
				<h4>Feature: Military Rank</h4>
				<p>
					You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a
					lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military
					encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
				</p>
				<h4>Variant Feature: Mercenary Life</h4>
				<p>
					You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the
					names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the
					language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" on the Other Rules page).
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and
					vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

					<h2>Teratologist</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Monsters are a fact of daily life on the frontiers of practically all worlds, and some individuals choose to devote their lives to the study of such creatures. Many of these teratologists do so
					in search of ways to manage the monsters, perhaps to tame them and make them useful to humanoid societies. Yet others do so in search of improved defenses against these creatures, or to better
					hunt them for components.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is easy however to get complacent in this field, to achieve a sense of mastery over the unknown terrors of the wilds. Those that fall into this trap find themselves prey to the very things
					they study. Of course, if one survives such an encounter they might learn more from the ordeal thanks to the firsthand experience.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Animal Handling, Survival<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Calligrapher's tools, cartographer's tools<br>
					<b>Languages:</b> Deep Speech.<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b>  A set of traveler's clothes, an explorer's pack, and a belt pouch containing 10gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: Xenophilia</h4>
				<p>
					You are adept at discerning the nature and function of monsters, which gives you an edge in your pursuit of them. You have advantage on Survival checks to track aberrations, beasts, and
					monstrosities, and can discern which of those a creature is just by looking at its footprints or other traces. You also have advantage on Insight checks made to discern the intentions of
					aberrations, beasts, and monstrosities with an intelligence of 5 or lower.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Teratology is exhausting dangerous work often undergone by those with an explorer's mindset. Many such individuals are bold and adventurous by nature, seeking out monsters in the most dangerous
					and out of the way places. So too do they often possess innate curiosity, at least where it pertains to the subject of monsters. This attitude can lead to carelessness however, as the pursuit of
					their quarry can blind teratologists to the threats around them. They are susceptible to overconfidence and often fall victim to the very thing they are hunting.

				<p>
					You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a
					constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or
					a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
				</p>
				<p>
					You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate
					circumstances and embark on a better life?
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Skill Proficiencies:</b> Sleight of Hand, Stealth<br>
					<b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Disguise kit, thieves' tools<br>
					<b>Equipment:</b> A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp
				</p>
				<h4>Feature: City Secrets</h4>
				<p>
					You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between
					any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.
				</p>
				<h4>Suggested Characteristics</h4>
				<p>
					Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire
					to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

			<h1 id="custombackground">Customizing a Background</h1>
			<p>
				You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose
				any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described
				on the Items page. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal. one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find
				a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.
			</p>
			<details> <!--Features Compiled-->
				<summary>
					<h2 style="display:inline-block;">Background Features Compiled</h2>
					<p>A list of every background feature in alphabetical order, including ones that aren't tied to any specific background.</p>
				</summary>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Adept Linguist -->
					<h4>Adept Linguist</h4>
					<p>
						You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of
						important words, expressions, and gestures—enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- All Eyes on You -->
					<h4>All Eyes on You</h4>
					<p>
						Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you
						also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few,
						might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Bad Reputation -->
					<h4>Bad Reputation</h4>
					<p>
						No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for
						food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- By Popular Demand -->
					<h4>By Popular Demand</h4>
					<p>
						You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of
						a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When
						strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- City Secrets -->
					<h4>City Secrets</h4>
					<p>
						You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel
						between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Court Functionary -->
					<h4>Court Functionary</h4>
					<p>
						Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are,
						whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Criminal Contact -->
					<h4>Criminal Contact</h4>
					<p>
						You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically,
						you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Cult Infiltrator -->
					<h4>Cult Infiltrator</h4>
					<p>
						You have infiltrated the ranks of a Cult. Having spied on the organization for quite some time, you are familiar with its inner workings and customs. You have a second identity as an initiate
						of the cult, enough of a facade to blend in as a simple grunt or servant.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Deep Delver -->
					<h4>Deep Delver</h4>
					<p>
						You have a knack for making your way in the deep places of the world. You can recall the twists and turns of passageways and tunnels such that you can always retrace your steps underground.
						You're also well acquainted with foraging and survival in the Underdark, and can determine when sources of food and water are safe to consume. You can always find sufficient food and water
						for yourself and up to five other people in the Underdark, as long as sustenance is available in the area.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Discovery -->
					<h4>Discovery</h4>
					<p>
						You have made a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the
						powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed
						some relic of the past that could rewrite history. Or it might be information that would be damaging to one or more powerful people. Work with your DM to determine the details of your
						discovery and its impact on the campaign.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Dragon Scholar -->
					<h4>Dragon Scholar</h4>
					<p>
						You have studied dragons and their lore for many years. You can automatically identify locations built or used by dragons and can identify dragon eggs and scales by sight. If you fail an
						Intelligence check to recall lore relating to dragons, you know someone or some book you can consult for the answer unless the DM rules that the lore is unknown.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Dungeoneering -->
					<h4>Dungeoneering</h4>
					<p>
						You have ample experience in planning and placing devices of suffering in spaces of torment. You have advantage on skill checks made to notice or discern how to disarm traps. You can also 
						perfectly recall the layout and physical details of any dungeon you have been inside within the last 6 months.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Echoes of Victory -->
					<h4>Echoes of Victory</h4>
					<p>
						You have attracted admiration among spectators, fellow athletes, and trainers in the region that hosted your past athletic victories. When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where
						you grew up, there is a 50 percent chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Faction Network -->
					<h4>Faction Agent</h4>
					<p>
						As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. When the faction assigns you a mission, it will usually
						provide you with the necessary supplies and transportation. Beyond this, you know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify covert operatives of your faction. Allies of your
						faction can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true
						identities if they are undercover.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- False Identity -->
					<h4>False Identity</h4>
					<p>
						You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including
						official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Guild Membership -->
					<h4>Guild Membership</h4>
					<p>
						You are an established and respected member of a guild, so you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if
						necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet
						potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
					</p>
					<p>
						Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can
						also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's
						coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Heart of Darkness -->
					<h4>Heart of Darkness</h4>
					<p>
						Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy
						and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Historical Knowledge -->
					<h4>Historical Knowledge</h4>
					<p>
						When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were dwarves, elves, humans, yuan-ti, or some other known race. In
						addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Homebound -->
					<h4>Homebound</h4>
					<p>
						You are skilled at maneuvering through the complex social structure of a noble house. In particular you find your expertise allows you a certain amount of freedom by masquerading as part of
						the staff. While you are dressed in a manservant's uniform within a place dedicated to high society, those of noble standing automatically perceive you as unimportant until you take hostile
						action. During this time you have advantage on Stealth, Sleight of Hand, and Deception checks made to maintain your cover.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Inheritance -->
					<h4>Inheritance</h4>
					<p>
						Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from among the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and
						what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for
						themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the
						object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at
						first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your in heritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep
						your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Inheritor -->
					<h4>Inheritor</h4>
					<p>
						An ancestor or mentor's deeds earned them a place in legend. Now it's your turn. You are the clear inheritor of a famed legacy. You've inherited a token from your predecessor, something that
						marks you as their inheritor, such as a signet ring, signature piece of clothing, or notable weapon.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, any time you reveal your legacy, you swiftly learn the local opinion of your predecessor. If locals have never heard of your predecessor, nothing changes. If they have, rumors
						of your connection spread swiftly, and many locals consider you either a hero or a threat. Heroes are welcomed and might easily gain an audience with local leaders. Threats are encouraged to
						leave before they invite danger.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Kept in Style -->
					<h4>Kept in Style</h4>
					<p>
						While you are anywhere where your house has influence, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and
						festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate to settle what you owe.
					</p>
					<p>
						This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not
						maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Knightly Regard -->
					<h4>Knightly Regard</h4>
					<p>
						You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other
						religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders
						can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Legalese -->
					<h4>Legalese</h4>
					<p>
						Your experience with your local legal system has given you a firm knowledge of the ins and outs of that system. Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like <i>ex
						injuria jus non oritur</i> and <i>cogitationis poenam nemo patitur</i> to frighten people into thinking that it is. With common folks who don't know any better, you
						might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Library Access -->
					<h4>Library Access</h4>
					<p>
						Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your organization's library, you have free and easy access to the
						majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Mercenary Life -->
					<h4>Mercenary life</h4>
					<p>
						You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including
						the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the
						language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "Practicing a Profession" under "Downtime Activities" on the Other Rules page).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Military Rank -->
					<h4>Military Rank</h4>
					<p>
						You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of
						a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly
						military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Mists Wanderer -->
					<h4>Mists Wanderer</h4>
					<p>
						The Mists whisper to you and guide you through their mysterious eddies. You immediately know if an object you're touching is a Mist talisman <span title="I'll probably add this one day to some place, probably with the DM info tho">
						(Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft pg61-63)</span>. You recognize where the talisman originates from if you have been to its domain of origin.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Official Inquiry -->
					<h4>Official Inquiry</h4>
					<p>
						You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can
						gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally,
						local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Position of Privilege -->
					<h4>Position of Privilege</h4>
					<p>
						Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make
						every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if
						you need to.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Researcher -->
					<h4>Researcher</h4>
					<p>
						When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library,
						scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply
						cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Respect of the Stout Folk -->
					<h4>Respect of the Stout Folk</h4>
					<p>
						As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where dwarves dwell, and the
						individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots) the finest accommodations and assistance.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Retainers -->
					<h4>Retainers</h4>
					<p>
						You have the service of three retainers loyal to you or your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can
						perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Rustic Hospitality -->
					<h4>Rustic Hospitality</h4>
					<p>
						You come from the ranks of the common folk, and you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be
						a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Secret Identity -->
					<h4>Secret Identity</h4>
					<p>
						You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of another faction. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that
						allow you to assume that persona and fit into the faction you're infiltrating. Consider why you're doing this infiltration work. Create a story on your own or use the table below to find a
						reason that suits you.

				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Shelter of the Faithful -->
					<h4>Shelter of the Faithful</h4>
					<p>
						You command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and
						care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but
						only you) at a modest lifestyle.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Ship's Passage -->
					<h4>Ship's Passage</h4>
					<p>
						When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on a ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations
						with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will
						determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Spirit Medium -->
					<h4>Spirit Medium</h4>
					<p>
						After a fateful experience, you believe you're aligned with spirits and can serve as a conduit for their insights and goals. You have advantage on any Arcana or Religion check you make to
						remember or research information about spirits and the afterlife. Additionally, you begin your adventuring career with a custom-made device for communing with otherworldly forces, perhaps a
						spirit board, a tarokka deck, an automatic writing planchette, dowsing rods, a cup for tea leaves, or a device of your own design. Add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make
						using this type of divining tool.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Supply Chain -->
					<h4>Supply Chain</h4>
					<p>
						From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or
						information.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Trauma Survivor -->
					<h4>Trauma Survivor</h4>
					<p>
						You survived. Whatever it was, you made it through, and you can help others do the same. People view you as an expert on the traumatic situation you faced—be it a specific sort of violence,
						illness, or otherwise. You are aware of nonmagical recovery techniques, common resources, and misinformation. You know how to speak to sympathetic doctors, clergy, and local leaders and can
						convince them to shelter one person (other than yourself) at a modest lifestyle for up to one month.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Traveler -->
					<h4>Traveler</h4>
					<p>
						You come from somewhere else, a place others couldn't begin to understand. Perhaps your home is a unique corner of the Land of the Mists or another world entirely. In any case, you and other
						travelers have shared experiences. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among sympathetic trading caravans, itinerant families, or displaced groups, so long as you don't present
						yourself as a danger. Such groups will hide you from the law or anyone searching for you, though they won't risk their lives for you. Additionally, you can tell whether an object you can
						see and touch is from your homeland with near perfect accuracy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Underdark Experience -->
					<h4>Underdark Experience</h4>
					<p>
						You are no casual visitor to the Underdark, but instead have spent considerable time there learning its ways. You are familiar with the various races, civilizations, and settlements of the
						Underdark, as well as its major routes for travel. If you fail an Intelligence check to recall some piece of Underdark lore, you know a source you can consult for the answer unless the DM
						rules that the lore is unknown.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Wanderer -->
					<h4>Wanderer</h4>
					<p>
						You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and
						fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Watcher's Eye -->
					<h4>Watcher's Eye</h4>
					<p>
						Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar
						organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bgfeature"><!-- Xenophilia -->
					<h4>Xenophilia</h4>
					<p>
						You are adept at discerning the nature and function of monsters, which gives you an edge in your pursuit of them. You have advantage on Survival checks to track aberrations, beasts, and
						monstrosities, and can discern which of those a creature is just by looking at its footprints or other traces. You also have advantage on Insight checks made to discern the intentions of
						aberrations, beasts, and monstrosities with an intelligence of 5 or lower.

			<!--
				This is where I compile every single personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw into one comprehensive table to roll on.
				consider adding stuff from the pointers on the class pages too
			-->
		</div>
		<div class="container"><!--The part where you write your DM a novel-->
			<h1 id="expandedbackstories">Your Life is Longer and Richer Than You Might Think.</h1>
			<p>
				The character page, class and race pages, and the list of backgrounds on this page provide all the information you need to define your character in preparation for a life of adventuring.
				What they don't do is account for all the circumstances that shaped your character during the years between your birth and the start of your career as a member of a class. What did your character
				accomplish or experience before deciding to become an adventurer? What were the circumstances of your birth? How large is your family, and what sorts of relationships do you have with your relatives?
				Which people were the greatest influences on you during your formative years, for better or worse? To answer these questions and more, you can use the tables and the advice in this section to compose
				a well-developed backstory for your character—an autobiography of sorts—that you can use to inform how you roleplay the character. In addition to deepening your own roleplaying experience, your
				character's history presents your DM with opportunities to weave those elements into the story of the campaign, drawing from this material to create situations and scenarios that build off your
				previous life experiences. Any way you look at it, adding definition to your character's pre-adventuring life is time well spent.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you're finished using these tables, you'll have a collection of facts and notes that—at a minimum—encapsulate what your character has been doing in the world up till now. Sometimes that might be
				all the information you want, but you don't have to stop there. By using your creativity to stitch all these bits together into a continuous narrative, you can create a full-fledged autobiography for
				your character in as little as a few sentences—an excellent example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Did you get a couple of results on the tables that don't outright contradict each other but also don't seem to fit together smoothly? If so, use your creativity to explain what happened to you! For
				instance, let's say you were born in a castle, but your childhood home was in the wilderness. It could be that your parents traveled from their forest home to seek help from a midwife at the castle
				when your mother was close to giving birth. Or your parents might have been members of the castle's staff before you were born, but they were released from service soon after you came into the world.
			</p>
			<h2>Section by Section</h2>
			<p>
				This tab is divided into 6 sections, each addressing a different aspect of your character's backstory. Each of the titles below is a link to quickly take you to that section, since I couldn't fit
				such links into the navigation bar. Note that not all backgrounds, races, and classes are covered by their respective relevant sections because of their varied sources.
			</p>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=origins"><h4>Origins</h4></a>
				<p>
					To find out who and where you came from, use the “Origins" section. When you're done, you will have a summary of facts about your parents, your siblings, and the circumstances under which you
					grew up.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=personaldecisions"><h4>Personal Decisions</h4></a>
				<p>
					These are tables that help you determine how you came to have the background you did, and what led you to be the class you are. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=lifeevents"><h4>Life Events</h4></a>
				<p>
					Your character's existence until now, no matter how brief or uneventful, has been marked by one or more life events—memorable happenings that have had an effect on who you are today.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=supplementals"><h4>Supplemental Tables</h4></a>
				<p>
					Your life has intersected with the lives of plenty Of other people, all the way from your infancy to today. When a result mentions such a person, you can use the supplemental tables to add needed
					details—such as race, class, or occupation—to that person. Some tables in the other sections direct you to one or more of the supplemental tables, and you can also use them any other time you see
					fit.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=prophecy"><h4>Prophecy</h4></a>
				<p>
					A prophecy is, in this context, a goal for your character, that you as a player can work towards. It is not your in-character goal; Rather, it is a plot point for you and your DM to work with, to
					help inform decisions about where to take both the character and the story. A prophecy also vaguely states some consequences of the event it predicts. Completing a prophecy should ideally confer
					your character a mechanical benefit of some kind, although the nature of such a benefit is entirely up to the DM.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="bgfeature">
				<a href="?l=mysterioussecrets"><h4>Mysterious Secrets</h4></a>
				<p>
					When creating a character, you might want to have a mysterious secret rather than a trinket. These secrets can serve as inspiration for either your traits or your prophecy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
			<p>
				The usual first step in creating your character's life story is to determine your early circumstances. Who were your parents? Where were you born? Did you have any siblings? Who raised you? You can
				address these questions by using the following tables.
			</p>
			<h4>Parents</h4>
			<p>
				You had parents, of course, even if they didn't raise you. To determine what you know about these people, use the Parents table. If you want, you can roll separately on the table for your mother and
				your father. Your parents are also referred to by other tables on this tab, which may or may not apply to your character.

				Who raised you, and what was life like for you when you were growing up? You might have been raised by your parents, by relatives, or in an orphanage. Or you could have spent your childhood on the
				streets of a crowded city with only your fellow runaways and orphans to keep you company. Use the Family table to determine who raised you. If you know who your parents are but you get a result that
				does not mention one or both of them, use the Absent Parent table to determine what happened.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, refer to the Family Lifestyle table to determine the general circumstances of your upbringing. (The Items page has more information about lifestyles, see Living Expenses.) The result on that
				table includes a number that is applied to your roll on the Childhood Home table, which tells you where you spent your early years. Wrap up this section by using the Childhood Memories table, which
				tells you how you were treated by other youngsters as you were growing up.

				No matter how long you've been alive, you have experienced at least one signature event that has markedly influenced your character. Life events include wondrous happenings and tragedies, conflicts
				and successes, and encounters with the unusual. They can help to explain why your character became an adventurer, and some might still affect your life even after they are long over.
			</p>
			<p>
				The older a character is, the greater the chance for multiple life events, as shown on the Life Events by Age table. If you have already chosen your character's starting age, see the entry in the
				Life Events column that corresponds to how old you are. Otherwise. you can roll dice to determine your current age and number of life events randomly. After you know the number of life events your
				character has experienced, roll once on the Life Events table for each of them. Many of the results on that table direct you to one of the secondary tables that follow. Once you have determined all
				of your character's life events, you can arrange them in any chronological order you see fit. At the DM's option, you might instead be allowed to roll on the Fateful Moments table under "Allies and

			<h2 id="prophecy">Prophecy</h2>
			<p>
				A prophecy influences your character's future. Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should
				have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met-for good or for ill. One of your prophecy goals should
				be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don't have to decide on all three goals at the start. You can
				choose your immediate goal now and think about the other two while you get a feel for the tone of the campaign. A trinket or a Mysterious Secret is a great resource for coming up with a prophecy.
			</p>
			<p>
				These prophecy goals can help your character stay motivated, but they'll also help your Dungeon Master create interesting stories that relate directly to your character. Your three prophecy goals can
				help the DM shape the campaign by determining what challenges or rewards to put in your character's way. Alternatively, you and your DM can work together to create goals that help link your character
				goals to an existing story the DM wants to tell. If you're looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that
				goal. If this goal isn't a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.
