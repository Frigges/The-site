			<h2>Barbarian</h2>
			<p>
				A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the
				unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.  For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world
				full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.
			</p>
			<p>
				The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian's driving force comes from a place that
				transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian
				becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury,
				until the last enemy falls. 
			</p>
			<h4>Primal Instinct</h4>
			<p>
				People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no
				virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature-keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They
				thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only
				a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
			</p>
			<h4>A Life of Danger</h4>
			<p>
				Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or
				she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters.
				Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little
				hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Barbarian</h4>
			<p>
				When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from
				a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common? 
			</p>
			<p>
				What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an
				invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you
				might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary>
					<p>
						It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype — a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear
						to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian
						stand out from all others; <b>click here to show some ideas.</b>
					</p>
				</summary>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<h4>Personal Totems</h4>
					<p>
						Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special
						significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character’s life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian’s past or a
						harbinger of what lies ahead.
					</p>
					<p>
						A personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian’s spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a
						bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle’s feather as a personal totem.
					</p>
					<p>
						Consider creating one or more personal totems for your character — objects that hold a special link to your character's past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character's
						actions.

					<h4>Superstitions</h4>
					<p>
						Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe
						that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and
						survive like the wild beasts they emulate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group. If your barbarian
						character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?

					<h4>Tattoo Suggestions</h4>
					<p>
						The members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's ancestors, or which symbolizes a
						feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian's tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individual's identity. If your character sports tattoos, what do they look like, and what do they represent?

			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every barbarian gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Rage</h4>
				<p>
					In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following effects if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
					<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian
						table.</li>
					<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
					<li>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can
					also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest
					before you can rage again.
				</p>
				<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
				<p>
					While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + you Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
				</p>
				<h4>Reckless Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so
					gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Danger Sense</h4>
				<p>At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</p>
				<p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
				<h4>Primal Knowledge</h4>
				<p>When you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level and again at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to barbarians at 1 st level.</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>Beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever  you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
				<h4>Fast Movement</h4>
				<p>Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.</p>
				<h4>Feral Instinct</h4>
				<p>By 7<sup>th</sup> level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally
					on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>
				<h4>Instinctive Pounce</h4>
				<p>Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level; As part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.</p>
				<h4>Brutal Critical</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 9<sup>th</sup> level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.<br>
					This increases to two additional dice at 13<sup>th</sup> level and three additional dice at 17<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Relentless Rage</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving
					throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.<br>
					Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
				</p>
				<h4>Persistent Rage</h4>
				<p>Beginning at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
				<h4>Indomitable Might</h4>
				<p>Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>
				<h4>Primal Champion</h4>
				<p>At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: The Primal Paths</h2>
			<p>
				Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal
				reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Ancestral Guardian -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/ancestralguardian.jpg" style="width:33%;">
				<p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a
					barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid. Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to
					protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors'
					deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p>
				<h4>Ancestral Protectors</h4>
				<p>
					Spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes
					the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature
					other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Shield</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of
					you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.<br>
					This reduction increases to 3d6 at 10<sup>th</sup> level and to 4d6 at 14<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Consult the Spirits</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Augury"><i>Augury</i></a> or
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Clairvoyance"><i>Clairvoyance</i></a> spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of 
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Clairvoyance"><i>Clairvoyance</i></a> invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.<br>
					After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Vengeful Ancestors</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force
					damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Battlerager -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Battlerager</h4></summary>
				<p>Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat,
					striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</p>
				<h4>Restriction: Dwarves Only</h4>
				<p>
					Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.<br>
					Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting.
				</p>
				<h4>Battlerager Armor</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Spiked Armor</i></h4>
					<p>Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.<br><br></p>
					<p>
						<b>Cost:</b> 75 gp<br>
						<b>AC:</b> 14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2)<br>
						<b>Stealth:</b> Disadvantage<br>
						<b>Weight:</b> 45 lb.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to use spiked armor (see the "Spiked Armor" sidebar) as a weapon.<br>
					While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the
					spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.<br>
					Additionally, when you use the Attack action to <a href="./combat.html?f=GrapplingaCreature">grapple</a> a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.	
				</p>
				<h4>Reckless Abandon</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are
					left when your rage ends.
				</p>
				<h4>Battlerager Charge</h4>
				<p>Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.</p>
				<h4>Spiked Retribution</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren’t incapacitated, and are wearing
					spiked armor.

				<p>
					Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.
					Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast
					table.
				</p>
				<h4>Frenzy</h4>
				<p>
					You can transform when you enter your rage, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon.
					It counts as a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it, as normal. You choose the weapon's form each time you rage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bite</b><br>
					Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, if you
					have less than half your hit points when you hit, you regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Claws</b><br>
					Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the
					Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Tail</b><br>
					You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you attacks you, you can use your reaction to
					swipe your tail and roll 1d8, applying a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled.
				</p>
				<h4>Bestial Soul</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
					immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which
					lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.</li>
					<li>You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
					<li>When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check's total. You can make this special check only once per turn.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Infectious Fury</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed
					on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or suffer one of the following effects (your choice):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.</li>
					<li>The target takes 2d12 psychic damage.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Call of the Hunt</h4>
				<p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you
					can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature
					that accepts this feature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can each use the following benefit once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the creature
					can roll 1d6 and gain a bonus to the damageequal to the number rolled.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Berserker -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Berserker</h4></summary>
				<p>
					For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill
					in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
				</p>
				<h4>Frenzy</h4>
				<p>
					You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus
					action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer <a href="./combat.html?l=Exhaustion">one level of exhaustion</a>.
				</p>
				<h4>Mindless Rage</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.
				</p>
				<h4>Intimidating Presence</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the
					creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you until the end of your next turn.
					On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out
					of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.<br>
					If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
				</p>
				<h4>Retaliation</h4>
				<p>Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Old Gods -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Old Gods</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Some barbarians hold deep faith and reverence for the ancient Old Gods, and view themselves as defenders of their sacred places. Keeping close ties to druids, they see themselves as warriors of
					the natural order, attuning to nature, animals, and the wild. These barbarians consider themselves natural weapons, born of the gods to stand against the enemies of their chosen deity. The Old
					Gods represent raw power, the untamed wild, and traditional worship. A barbarian who follows the Old Gods is often close to nature, and sees glorious battle as the arena of their gods, and their
					purpose is to destroy the enemies of their chosen god.
				</p> <!--Damage die to d8, d10 at 14 is the current suggestion. take away the three attacks at 14-->
				<h4>Ancestral Protectors</h4>
				<p>
					You are relentless in battle, filled with a bloodlust and rage of the Old Gods. You are proficient with improvised weapons. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 damage + your Strength modifier, And
					you deal increased damage with improvised weapons based on their size, 1d8 for a tiny object, 1d10 for a small object, and 1d12 for a medium or larger object. An object's size might not be
					immediately obvious, but it follows roughly the same logic as creature sizes: The broken-off leg of a chair is a Tiny object, an ordinary chair is Small, and a barrel of wine is Medium.
					Additionally, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All melee weapons you wield that aren't light gain the heavy and thrown properies, including improvised weapons. A weapon which doesn't specify a thrown range gains a range of 30/60 while
						you are wielding it.</li>
					<li>Once on your turn when you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, you can try to <a href="./combat.html?f=GrapplingaCreature">grapple or shove</a> that creature as part of the same attack.</li>
					<li>If your size is Small, you don't have disadvantage on attack rolls when wielding a heavy weapon</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Imbued by the Gods</h4>
				<p>Your natural strength is amplified, and the gods you worship bestow upon you inhuman capabilities. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can
					push, drag, or lift. Your long jump and high jump are doubled.</p>
				<h4>Adaptable Combatant</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, your ability to grab enemies and turn anything into a weapon grows stronger. You gain the following
					benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can try to grapple or shove a creature up to two size categories larger than you.</li>
					<li>Your speed is no longer halved when you try to move a creature you're grappling.</li>
					<li>Your unarmed strikes and attacks with improvised weapons count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
					<li>You can treat a creature you are grappling as an improvised weapon. The damage this improvised weapon deals is based on the creature's size, as with objects. When you hit another target
						using a grappled creature as an improvised weapon, the grappled creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier plus your proficiency bonus. When you use a creature as an improvised
						weapon, thrown attacks made with it have a range of 10/20 feet.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Brutal Kills</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, while you are raging, if you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to kill them brutally, tearing off limbs, and savaging your enemy. The violent
					display terrifies those around you. Any enemies that can see you must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you for the next minute. The save DC is 8 + your proficiency
					bonus + your strength modifier. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest you can do so again.
				</p>
				<h4>Gifts of the Gods</h4>
				<p>At 14<sup>th</sup> level, The Old Gods choose you as their divine weapon, a tool to be used against their enemies. You gain the following benefits:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can grapple or shove any creature, regardless of size.</li>
					<li>You can add your Strength score to the range of all thrown weapons.</li>
					<li>When you shove a creature, you can push it 10 feet.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Storm Herald -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Storm Herald</h4></summary>
				<p>
					All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle
					of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.<br>
					Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms,
					in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.
				</p>
				<h4>Storm Aura</h4>
				<p>
					You emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.<br>
					Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura’s effect
					depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class. If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals
					8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Desert:</b> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at
					5<sup>th</sup> level, 4 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, 5 at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and 6 at 20<sup>th</sup> level.<br>
					<b>Sea:</b> When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a
					failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, 3d6 at 15<sup>th</sup> level,
					and 4d6 at 20<sup>th</sup> level.<br>
					<b>Tundra:</b> When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when
					you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5<sup>th</sup> level, 4 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, 5 at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and 6 at 20<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Storm Soul</h4>
				<p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Desert:</b> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable
					object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.<br>
					<b>Sea:</b> You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.<br>
					<b>Tundra:</b> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don't suffer the effects of extreme cold, as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn
					a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.
				</p>
				<h4>Shielding Storm</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the
					creature is in your Storm Aura.
				</p>
				<h4>Raging Storm</h4>
				<p>At 14<sup>th</sup> level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Desert:</b> Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
					takes fire damage equal to half your barbarian level.<br>
					<b>Sea:</b> When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a>,
					as if struck by a wave.<br>
					<b>Tundra:</b> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is
					reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.

				<summary><h4>Path of Terror</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/72554862.jpg">		
				<p>
					Key to the identity of a barbarian is their legendary rage. Many variants of barbarian will utilize their anger in a slew of ways, but unique among barbarians are those devoted to the Path of
					Terror. By tapping into the horror of the world around them (filled with monsters as it inevitably is) and their own fear, they elevate their rage to astounding feats of physical prowess that
					allow them to escape or survive that which would claim a normal person. As well, many such barbarians have proven proficient in invoking this same fear in their allies such that they too can
					take flight when the situation calls for it.
				</p>
				<h4>Terrified Rage</h4>
				<p>
					You revel in the experience of being afraid, and in turn can utilize the emotional energy it provides you to strengthen your martial prowess. When you rage, you may choose to become
					<a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> as well. When you are frightened you do not suffer the normal penalties to ability checks and attack rolls, nor are you unable to move closer
					to the source of your fear. If you become frightened due to raging, and thus do not have a specific source for your fear, you must choose a hostile creature or trap* you can see to be the source
					of your fear. If you cannot select a source for your fear, you may not become frightened when you rage and instead follow the normal rules for raging.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your rage damage is doubled for attacks against the source of your fear. In addition, if a creature or effect would have you become frightened, you may begin to rage without expending one of 
					your rages. Your rage is also sustained so long as you are frightened.
				</p>
				<p>
					*<i>A trap is any inanimate thing that would inflict damage or effect you consider harmful upon being triggered or interacted with. For the purposes of your rage, even natural hazards, such as a
					cliff high enough to inflict falling damage, or a sinkhole full of trapping mud, can be considered as traps.</i>
				</p>
				<h4>Fight or Flight</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned to harness the surge of adrenaline that courses through your veins once you become frightened. You have advantage on attack rolls against
					creatures you are afraid of, and you may roll 1d4 and add the result to any Acrobatics or Athletics checks and saving throws you make as long as you can see the source of your fear.
				</p>
				<h4>Bravely Run Away</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, seeking to escape that which scares you has fostered in you a nearly supernatural ability to remove yourself and your friends from a situation. While you are
					frightened, you and any creature that begins its turn within 15 feet of you may use a bonus action to Dash so long as they end that movement further from the source of your fear than they began.
				</p>
				<h4>Existential Dread</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned to harness the fear of being in mortal danger and turn it into a potent motivating force. While you are frightened, for every 10 hit points you are
					missing below half of your maximum, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. For example if your maximum hit points is 120 and you currently have 40 hit points,
					the bonus would be a +2 (for being at 20 less than half your maximum hit points). You must be conscious to gain this bonus and the bonus amount may not exceed your proficiency bonus.

				<summary><h4>Path of the Totem Warrior</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/72554862.jpg">		
				<p>
					The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might,
					adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.<br>
					Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Seeker</h4>
				<p>
					Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3<sup>rd</sup> level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the
					<a href="./spells.html?l=BeastSense"><i>Beast Sense</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=SpeakWithAnimals"><i>Speak With Animals</i></a> spells, but only as rituals, as described on the
					Combat &amp; Casting page.
				</p>
				<h4>Totem Spirit</h4>
				<p>
					You choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that
					incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you
					have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes might turn bright yellow.<br>
					Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle, a horse or stag,
					rather than an elk, or a lion, panther, or other big cat, rather than a tiger. The effects of the totem animal remains the same, however, unless your DM decides otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bear:</b> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.<br>
					<b>Eagle:</b> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on
					your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.<br>
					<b>Elk:</b> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.<br>
					<b>Tiger:</b> While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.<br>
					<b>Wolf:</b> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of
					hunters.
				</p>
				<h4>Aspect of the Beast</h4>
				<p>At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3<sup>rd</sup> level or a different one.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bear:</b> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break
					objects.<br>
					<b>Eagle:</b> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from
					you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Perception checks.<br>
					<b>Elk:</b> You gain the roaming abilities of an elk. Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and
					you're not incapacitated (see the Adventuring page for rules on travel pace).<br>
					<b>Tiger:</b> You gain the survival instincts of a tiger. You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival.<br>
					<b>Wolf:</b> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see the
					Adventuring page for rules on travel pace).
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Walker</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=CommuneWithNature"><i>Commue With Nature</i></a> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the
					animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.
				</p>
				<h4>Totemic Attunement</h4>
				<p>At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bear:</b> While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature.
					An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.<br>
					<b>Eagle:</b> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is
					holding you aloft.<br>
					<b>Elk:</b> While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your
					Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked <a href="./combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a> and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.<br>
					<b>Tiger:</b> While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action
					to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.<br>
					<b>Wolf:</b> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature <a href="./combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a> when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

				<p>
					Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can
					profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused
					barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.
				</p>
				<h4>Wild Surge</h4>
				<p>
					The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced. If the effect requires a saving
					throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Magic Awareness</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the
					location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to. You can use this feature a number
					of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Bolstering Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the
					following benefits of your choice to that creature:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For 10 minutes, the creature can roll 1d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll.</li>
					<li>Roll 1d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature's choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature
						can't receive it again until after a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Unstable Backlash</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out; immediately after you take damage or fail a saving throw while raging, you can use
					your reaction to roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.
				</p>
				<h4>Controlled Surge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice,
					you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Zealot -->
				<summary><h4>Path of the Zealot</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots – warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.<br>
					A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general,
					the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.	
				</p>
				<h4>Divine Fury</h4>
				<p>
					You can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a
					weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Warrior of the Gods</h4>
				<p>
					Your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=RaiseDead"><i>Raise Dead</i></a>, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster
					doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.
				</p>
				<h4>Fanatical Focus</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while you're raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can
					use this ability only once per rage.
				</p>
				<h4>Zealous Presence</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of
					your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.<br>
					Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Rage Beyond Death</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.<br>
					While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However,
					if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

			<h2>Bard</h2>
			<p>
				Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her
				song-knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.
			</p>
			<p>
				A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and
				emboldens them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some
				measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the
				land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a leveI of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards
				apart fram their fellows.
			</p>
			<h4>Music and Magic</h4>
			<p>
				In the worlds of DnD, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the
				multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an
				attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But
				bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive
				spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from
				musical performance to esoteric knowledge.
			</p>
			<h4>Learning from Experience</h4>
			<p>
				Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring
				career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange
				places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other
				bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The arrival of a renowned bard is a special occasion, akin to the visit of a dignitary. A bard can reasonably expect at least a hot supper and a clean place to sleep from a local landlord or inn in
				exchange for a few songs or stories. A noble might host a bard in fine style—while also being careful to guard any secrets the noble's household doesn't want retold or sung across the land.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Bard</h4>
			<p>
				Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories they tell about them. Perhaps you had a
				secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. or your childhood might be worthy of a story.
				Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore
				and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master.
				Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

				<summary>
					<p>
						Many things can define your bard, not just the things listed above. For example: a muse, a defining work, a signature instrument, or a big embarassment on their part. If you want to use
						any of this to spice up your character, <b>click here to show some ideas.</b>
					</p>
				</summary>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<h4>A Bard's Muse</h4>
					<p>
						Naturally, every bard has a repertoire of songs and stories. Some bards are generalists who can draw from a wide range of topics for each performance, and who take pride in their versatility.
						Others adopt a more personal approach to their art, driven by their attachment to a muse—a particular concept that inspires much of what those bards do in front of an audience. A bard who
						follows a muse generally does so to gain a deeper understanding of what that muse represents and how to best convey that understanding to others through performance. If your bard character
						has a muse, it could be one of the three described here, or one of your own devising.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Nature:</b> You feel a kinship with the natural world, and its beauty and mystery inspire you. For you, a tree is deeply symbolic, its roots delving into the dark unknown to draw forth the
						power of the earth, while its branches reach toward the sun to nourish their flowers and fruit. Nature is the ancient witness who has seen every kingdom rise and fall, even those whose names
						have been forgotten and wait to be rediscovered. The gods of nature share their secrets with druids and sages, opening their hearts and minds to new ways of seeing, and as with those
						individuals, you find that your creativity blossoms while you wander in an open field of waving grass or walk in silent reverence through a grove of ancient oaks.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Love:</b> You are on a quest to identify the essence of true love. Though you do not disdain the superficial love of flesh and form, the deeper form of love that can inspire thousands or
						bring joy to one's every moment is what you are interested in. Love of this sort takes on many forms, and you can see its presence everywhere—from the sparkling of a beautiful gem to the song
						of a simple fisher thanking the sea for its bounty. You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with
						vitality and passion.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Conflict:</b> Drama embodies conflict, and the best stories have conflict as a key element. From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat
						to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to
						shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and
						small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<h4>Defining Work</h4>
					<p>
						Every successful bard is renowned for at least one piece of performance art, typically a song or a poem that is popular with everyone who hears it. These performances are spoken about for
						years by those who view them, and some spectators have had their lives forever changed because of the experience. If your character is just starting out, your ultimate defining work is likely
						in the future. But in order to make any sort of living at your profession, chances are you already have a piece or two in your repertoire that have proven to be audience pleasers.

					<h4>Instrument</h4>
					<p>
						In a bard's quest for the ultimate performance and the highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as important as one's vocal ability. The instrument's quality of manufacture is a critical
						factor, of course; the best ones make the best music, and some bards are continually on the lookout for an improvement. Perhaps just as important, though, is the instrument's own
						entertainment value; those that are bizarrely constructed or made of exotic materials are likely to leave a lasting impression on an audience.
					</p>
					<p>
						You might have an “off the rack” instrument, perhaps because it's all you can afford right now. Or, if your first instrument was gifted to you, it might be of a more elaborate sort. Are you
						satisfied with the instrument you have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly distinctive?

					<h4>Embarassment</h4>

						Almost every bard has suffered at least one bad experience in front of an audience, and chances are you're no exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; perhaps you had a few
						small difficulties early in your career, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputation after one agonizing night when the fates conspired to bring about your theatrical ruin.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ways that a performance can go wrong are as varied as the fish in the sea. No matter what sort of disaster might occur, however, a bard has the courage and the confidence to rebound from
						it—either pressing on with the show (if possible) or promising to come back tomorrow with a new performance that's guaranteed to please.

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every bard gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different
					situations. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Slots" for the bard spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for bard spells. You can use a
					musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard
					table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice.
					Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
					level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it wilh another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level
					for which you have spell slots.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells. you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
					expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level
					spell slot available, you can cast it using either slot.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ritual Casting</b><br>
					You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.
				</p>
				<h4>Bardic Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That
					creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
					makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide hefore the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
					Inspiration die is rolled. it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when
					you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5<sup>th</sup> level, a d10 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, and a d12 at 15<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Bardic Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change in focus as you use your skills and magic:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Replace one of the skills you chose for the Expertise feature with one of your other skill proficiencies that isn't benefiting from Expertise.</li>
					<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the bard spell list.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Jack of All Trades</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
				</p>
				<h4>Magical Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, if a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a
					target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.
				</p>
				<h4>Song of Rest</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your
					performance spends hit dice to regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
				</p>
				<p>
					The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9<sup>th</sup> level, to 1d10 at 13<sup>th</sup>
					level, and to 1d12 at 17<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Expertise</h4>
				<p>
					At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10<sup>th</sup>
					level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.
				</p>
				<h4>Font of Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Countercharm</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of
					your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to
					gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated, silenced, or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
				</p>
				<h4>Magical Secrets</h4>
				<p>
					By 10<sup>th</sup> level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you
					can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.
				</p>
				<p>You learn two additional spells from any class at 14<sup>th</sup> level and again at 18<sup>th</sup> level.</p>
				<h4>Superior Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 20<sup>th</sup> level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Bard Colleges</h2>
			<p>
				The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call
				colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Creation -->
				<summary><h4>College of Creation</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/54387923.jpg" style="width:40%;">
				<p>
					Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art—the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the
					Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was
					the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and
					you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance."
				</p>
				<h4>Mote of Potential</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is
					intangible and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose. When
					the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ability Check:</b><br>
					When the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits
					colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Attack Roll:</b><br>
					Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you
					can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Saving Throw:</b><br>
					Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points
					equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
				</p>
				<h4>Performance of Creation</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in
					a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can't be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly, and a creature can faintly
					hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see the Items page. Once you create an item
					with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this
					feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes. The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one
					size category when you reach 6<sup>th</sup> level (Large) and 14<sup>th</sup> level (Huge).

					</p>
				</details>
				<h4>Animating Performance</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, As an action, you can target a Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat
					block, which uses your proficiency bonus. The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
				</p>
				<p>'
					In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge
					action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can
					take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only
					one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.
				</p>
				<h4>Creative Crescendo</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of two
					items). If you create an item that would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the
					rest must be Small or Tiny. You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.
				</p>

				<summary><h4>College of Doomsayers</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://hearthstone.wiki.gg/images/thumb/5/55/Darkshire_Councilman_full.jpg/800px-Darkshire_Councilman_full.jpg">
				<p>Bards of the college of doomsayers revel in the fear and despair of others. They have foreseen the end of times, and use their gifts of prophecy to instill terror in those who hear their words.
					These bards command an audience like any other, but their craft is that of a mad prophet, and their poems and songs echo dissonant rattlings of hopelessness and suffering. Those who hear the
					mad ramblings are stricken with fear, lose their wills, and fall into madness.</p>
				<h4>The End is Nigh</h4>
				<p>
					Your words strike fear into the hearts of those who bear witness to your doomsaying. Whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, you may treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled
					a 10.
				</p>
				<h4>Dreadful Words</h4>
				<p>
					As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target takes psychic damage equal to the roll of your Bardic
					inspiration die and must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you until the start of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>True Believer</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you become convinced of your impending doom. You no longer fear death. You are immune to being frightened, and gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed.
				</p>
				<h4>Prophetic Foresight</h4>
				<p>
					Also, starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can behold glimpses of the most disastrous outcome for every possible action. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll,
					ability check, or saving throw, you use your reaction and attempt to make these visions come true. The triggering creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a
					failed saving throw, the triggering attack roll misses or the triggering ability check or saving throw fails. On a successful saving throw, the creature makes the attack roll, ability check, or
					saving throw normally, and you do not expend your use of this ability. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You regain expended uses
					when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>For Whom the Bell Tolls</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, When you roll initiative, you may choose a target within 60 feet of you that you can see. You foretell that creature's immediate demise. During the first
					round of combat, any attacks against that creature have advantage.
				</p>
				<h4>Impending Doom</h4>
				<p>Also beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, a creature frightened of you has disadvantage on all saving throws it makes while it can see you.</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Eloquence -->

				<p>Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments and
					plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.</p>
				<h4>Silver Tounge</h4>
				<p>
					You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
				</p>
				<h4>Unsettling Words</h4>
				<p>
					You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see
					within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Unfailing Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack
					roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.
				</p>
				<h4>Universal Speech</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your
					Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
					until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to use it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Infectious Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you successfully inspire someone, the power of your eloquence can spread to someone else. When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic
					Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can use your reaction to encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you
					within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier
					(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Glamour -->
				<summary><h4>College of Glamour</h4></summary>
				<p>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other
					fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others. The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These
					bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows
					them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college
					instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p>
				<h4>Mantle of Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When
					you do so, choose a number of creatures you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit
					points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.<br>
					The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5<sup>th</sup> level, 11 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, and 14 at 15<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Enthralling Performance</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to charge your performance with seductive fey magic. If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the
					end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must
					succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it
					hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you
					attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it. Once you use this feature,
					you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Mantle of Majesty</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Command"><i>Command</i></a>, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you
					were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=Command"><i>Command</i></a> as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a spell slot. Any
					creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the <a href="./spells.html?l="><i>Command</i></a> you cast with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
					until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Unbreakable Majesty</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce. In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic
					presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw
					against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on
					this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn. Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a short or
					long rest.

				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:40%;margin-top:-0.7em;" src="https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/art_crop/front/3/e/3ed021d2-e2bc-44b3-8934-4bd02e0a42ec.jpg">
				<p>
					Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns
					or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything
					they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
				</p>
				<p>
					The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that
					the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one
					another. They also meet at festivaIs or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
				</p>
				<h4>Cutting Words</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
					ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's
					roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals
					its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.
				</p>
				<h4>Additional Magical Secrets</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count
					as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.
				</p>
				<h4>Peerless Skill</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic lnspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You
					call choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

				<p>
					Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power—be they legends, histories, or fictions—and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual
					embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Storytellers, like bards of the College of Spirits, often give voice to tales inspired by some greater theme or body of work. When determining what stories you tell, consider what unites them.
					Do they all feature characters from a specific group, like archetypes from the tarokka deck, figures from constellations, childhood imaginary friends, or characters in a particular storybook? Or
					are your inspirations more general , incorporating historic champions, mythological heroes, or urban legends? Use the tales you tell to define your niche as a storytelling adventurer.
				</p>
				<h4>Guiding Whispers</h4>
				<p>
					You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=Guidance"><i>Guidance</i></a> cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of bard cantrips you
					know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.
				</p>
				<h4>Spiritual Focus</h4>
				<p>
					You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle,
					crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.
				</p>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll
					of the spell equal to the number rolled.
				</p>
				<h4>Tales from Beyond</h4>
				<p>
					You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the
					Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a short or
					long rest. If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again
					until you roll it again. You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Session</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using
					your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to your proficiency bonus (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one
					spell of your choice from any class.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must be of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of divination
					or necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a long rest, and you know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Mystical Connection</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose
					which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Swords -->
				<summary><h4>College of Swords</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock
					combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right. Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One
					blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and
					powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is
					too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with medium armor and the scimitar. If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
				</p>
				<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
				<p>
					You adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if something in the game lets you choose again.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Dueling:</b><br>
					When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Two-Weapon Fighting:</b><br>
					When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
				</p>
				<h4>Blade Flourish</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a
					weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Defensive:</b><br>
					You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add
					the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Slashing:</b><br>
					You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you.
					The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Mobile:</b><br>
					You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also
					push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an
					unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.
				</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Master's Flourish</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.
				</p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Valor -->
				<summary><h4>College of Valor</h4></summary>
				<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls
					or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass
					from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
				</p>
				<h4>Combat Inspiration</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when
					an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before
					knowing whelher it hits or misses.
				</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Magic</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you can make one weapon
					attack as a bonus action.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- College of Whispers -->
				<summary><h4>College of Whispers</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling
					tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn
					them against others through extortion and threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their
					true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.
				</p>
				<h4>Psychic Blades</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an
					extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn. The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at
					5<sup>th</sup> level, 5d6 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, and 8d6 at 15<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Words of Terror</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror. If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind.
					At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in
					this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried
					to frighten it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Mantle of Whispers</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this
					shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This
					disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance.
					Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on
					its memories.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check. Once you capture a shadow
					with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Shadow Lore</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature's deepest fears. As an action, you magically whisper a phrase that only one creature of
					your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't
					hear you.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect. On a failed saving throw, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your
					allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is
					convinced you know it. The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so.
					It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend. When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear. Once you use this feature, you can't use
					it again until you finish a long rest.

			<h2>Cleric</h2>
			<p>
				Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.
			</p>
			<p>
				Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a cleric—someone who
				is not only a devout worshiper, but who has also been invested with a measure of a deity's power. The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep devotion
				to one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the deity who sees the potential in a person and calls that individual into service? Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn't matter.
				However clerics come into being, the world needs clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.
			</p>
			<h4>Healers and Warriors</h4>
			<p>
				Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this
				power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites,
				but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down
				flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those heathens who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of
				the gods on their side.
			</p>
			<h4>Divine Agents</h4>
			<p>
				Not everyone who pursues a religious vocation is a true cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic
				and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics
				are rare in most hierarchies. A few souls who are denied the path of the cleric become embittered and seek favor with sinister or forbidden gods or forge pacts with other powerful entities. Religious
				scholars debate whether<br>divine rejection led such a person to embrace a dark path or whether the person was rejected because the gods foresaw the<br>potential for darkness in the person's
				future. The gods remain silent on the matter.
			</p>
			<div class="notes" style="float:right;margin-top:-50px;">
				<h4><i>Serving a Pantheon, Philosophy, or Force</i></h4>
				<p>
					The typical cleric is an ordained servant of a particular god and chooses a Divine Domain associated with that deity. The cleric's magic flows from the god or the god's sacred realm, and often
					the cleric bears a holy symbol that represents that divinity. However, some clerics, especially in a world like Eberron, serve a whole pantheon, rather than a single deity. In certain campaigns,
					a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such as life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, peace, or one of the nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
					explores options like these, in the section “Gods of your World.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Talk with your DM about the divine options available in your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philosophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your cleric ends up serving,
					choose a Divine Domain that is appropriate for it, and if it doesn't have a holy symbol, work with your DM to design one. The cleric's class features often refer to your deity. If you are devoted
					to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, your cleric features still work for you as written. Think of the references to a god as references to the divine thing you serve that gives you your
					magic.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting
				evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations,
				or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a
				cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Cleric</h4>
			<p>
				As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principies you want your character to embody, The Other Rules page includes lists of many of the gods
				of the multiverse, Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
				Onee you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god, Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your
				wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to
				prove yourself worthy of a great quest?

					<h4>Temple</h4>
					<p>
						Most clerics start their lives of service as priests in an order, then later realize that they have been blessed by their god with the qualities needed to become a cleric. To prepare for this
						new duty, candidates typically receive instruction from a cleric of a temple or another place of study devoted to their deity. Some temples are cut off from the world so that their occupants
						can focus on devotions, while other temples open their doors to minister to and heal the masses. What is noteworthy about the temple you studied at?

			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every cleric gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the cleric spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting
					ability for cleric spells. You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
					column of the Cleric table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>
					The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
					all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
					You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
					your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two
					2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
					<a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>
					You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for
					each spell on your list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ritual Casting</b><br>
					You can cast any cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with three such effects: Harness Divine Power,
					Turn Undead, and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you use your Channel Divinity. you choose which effect to create. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect, the DC is your cleric spell save DC.
					You can Channel Divinity a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier, rounded down, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power</b><br>
					As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</b><br>
					As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
					fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move
					to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to
					move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
				</p>
				<h4>Cantrip Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip
					from the cleric spell list.
				</p>
				<h4>Destroy Undead</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain
					threshold, as shown on the Destroy Undead table.

				<h4>Blessed Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 8<sup>th</sup> level, you are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature or object takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant
					damage to that creature or object. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
					assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric leveI, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect
					of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long
					rest. At 20<sup>th</sup> level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Divine Domains</h2>
			<p>
				Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities.<br>
				The divine domains you can choose are directly tied to the god you serve. If your god doesn't preside over a given domain, you can't choose it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Domain Spells</b><br>
				Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count
				against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Arcana -->
				<summary><h4>Arcana Domain</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods,
					magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Forgotten Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as
					well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and
					Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of
					your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned, as by the Turn
					Undead feature for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
				</p>

				<h4>Arcane Mastery</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you choose four spells from the wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your

					The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of
					necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Bhaal and Pyremius), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), or pain (Iuz

					can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Touch of Death</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal
					extra necrotic damage to that creature. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric level.
				</p>
				<h4>Inescapable Destruction</h4>

					The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows
					of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought
					object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.
					Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar,
					Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

				<h4><br>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.
				</p>
				<h4>Blessing of the Forge</h4>
				<p>
					you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of
					your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. Once you use this
					feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items. You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or
					martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal Object (see the Items page for examples of these items). The creation is completed at the end of the
					hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.
				</p>
				<p>
					The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal
					irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that
					contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.
				</p>
				<h4>Soul of the Forge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your mastery of the forge grants you resistance to fire damage, as well as a +1 bonus to AC while wearing heavy armor.
				</p>
				<h4>Searing Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					Your Blessed Strikes feature deals fire damage instead of radiant damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Saint of Forge and Fire</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful. You gain immunity to fire damage, and have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
					damage while wearing heavy armor.

				<p>
					Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an
					abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to
					rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish
					in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.

				<h4><br>Cricle of Mortality</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead
					use the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=SparetheDying"><i>Spare the Dying</i></a> cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of
					cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
				</p>
				<h4>Eyes of the Grave</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect
					undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't
					tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you
					finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature's life force for termination. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you,
					cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then
					the curse ends.
				</p>
				<h4>Sentinel at Death's Door</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to impede death's progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into
					a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when
					you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Keeper of Souls</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature
					of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren’t incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do
					so again until the start of your next turn.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Knowledge of the Ages</h4>

					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with
					the chosen skill or tool.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it. As an action, choose one
					creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you
					finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet
					of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Suggestion"><i>Suggestion</i></a> spell on the creature
					without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Visions of the Past</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then
					receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. Vou can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
					were casting a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Object Reading:</b><br>
					Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most
					recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1
					additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Area Reading:</b><br>
					As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your
					Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and
					betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerais. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

					immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Demand Compliance</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice
					that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can
					also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.
				</p>
				<h4>Embodiment of the Law</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others. If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1 st level or higher,
					you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom
					modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Compelling Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					Your Blessed Strikes deal psychic damage instead of radiant damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Commune's Wrath</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Blessed Strike damage to a creature on your turn,
					you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse
					ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.

					The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick
					and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as
					Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods  of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and
					community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

				<h4><br>Disciple of Life</h4>
				<p>
					Your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's
					level. You also gain proficiency with heavy armor.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of
					hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of
					its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on a construct. If you use this feature on an undead, that creature instead takes that much radiant damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Blessed Healer</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you
					regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.
				</p>
				<h4>Supreme Healing</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example,
					instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

					Gods of light—including Hehn, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty-promote the ideais of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often
					using the symbol of the sun. Some of those gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow
					and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with
					radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=Light"><i>Light</i></a> cantrip. Also, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an altacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30
					feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to fiare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be
					blinded is immune to this feature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes. As an action, you present your holy symbol,
					and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal
					to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Flare</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature thal you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.
				</p>
				<h4>Corona of Light</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a
					60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

				<summary><h4>Nature Domain</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with
					particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their
					own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil
					monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

					heavy armor.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant
					creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is

				</p>
				<h4>Dampen Elements</h4>

				<p>
					The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and
					to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes.
					These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

				<h4><br>Implement of Peace</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in the Insight, Performance, or Persuasion skill (your choice).
				</p>
				<h4>Emboldening Bond</h4>
				<p>
					You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to
					your proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4
					and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. You can use this feature a number of times
					equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks,
					and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A
					creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.
				</p>
				<h4>Protective Bond</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second
					bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.
				</p>
				<h4>Expansive Bond</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, the benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses
					Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.

					choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to be enveloped by the cloak of the night (which can be yourself). While the cloak lasts, that creature has resistance to all damage while
					it is in dim light or darkness.<br>
					In addition, when you draw the cloak of night, all nonmagical light sources within 60 feet of you become extinguished. Magical light sources are dispelled if they were created by a spell with a
					level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus.
				</p>
				<h4>Shifting Shadows</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can twist shadow around other creatures to pull them through space. As an action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that is in
					dim light or darkness. You teleport that creature up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. The chosen space must be on a surface or
					in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC is unaffected.<br>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Ennervating Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					Your Blessed Strikes feature deals cold damage instead of radiant damage, and deals additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Reborn in Darkness</h4>

					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you regain 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns while you are in darkness. If you take radiant damage, this regeneration doesn't function until

				<h4>Eyes of Night</h4>
				<p>

				</p>
				<h4>Vigilant Blessing</h4>
				<p>

				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your Channel Divinity to refresh your allies with soothing twilight. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a sphere of twilight emanates

				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever a creature (including you) ends its turn in the sphere, you can grant that creature one of these benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You grant it temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your cleric level.</li>
					<li>You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed or frightened.</li>

				<p>
					War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either
					case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as
					prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares)
					and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations
					and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

			<h2>Druid</h2>
			<p>
				Holding high a gnarled slaff wreathed wilh holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive balls of lighlning to smile the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.
			</p>
			<p>
				Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the
				cultists' aclivilies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over
				nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
			</p>
			<h4>Power of Nature</h4>
			<p>
				Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent
				union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in
				contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.
			</p>
			<p>
				Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a
				particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.
			</p>
			<h4>Preserve the Balance</h4>
			<p>
				For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others,
				the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to
				the exclusion of others. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in
				opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and
				vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especcially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.
			</p>
			<div class="notes" style="float:right">
				<h4><i>Moonwells</i></h4>
				<p>
					Some circles gather around sacred pools known as moonwells, their link between the natural world and the gods of old, ringed by standing stone circles, raised by their ancient ancestors.
				</p>
				<p>
					The water of a moonwell, drunk directly from cupped hands, restores 1d8 hit points, plus the drinker's Wisdom bonus, if any. If the drinker has threatened the balance of nature since the last
					full moon, the water instead deals 1d8 poison damage to the drinker. This damage is also dealt by a corrupted moonwell. Either effect occurs once only per day per drinker. On the nights of the
					full moon, drinking the water of a moonwell can, at the DM's discretion, have additional effects, such as conferring the benefits of a <i>Lesser Restoration</i> spell. Moonwell water placed in a
					container or taken more than 30 feet away from the well no longer has any of these properties; it is simply water.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the three nights of the full moon, three or more druids gathered around a moonwell can cast <i>Commune</i> and <i>Scrying</i> once each without expending spell slots and without material
					components, provided that one of the druids is at least 9<sup>th</sup> level and the rest are at least 4<sup>th</sup> level. At the DM's option, the druids can use a moonwell on such nights to
					cast different spells.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on
				a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.
			</p>
			<h4>Druids and the Gods</h4>
			<p>
				Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse. The worship of these deities is often considered a
				more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers,
				foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the
				Earth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.
			</p>
			<h4>Druidic Circles</h4>
			<p>
				Druidic ways are ancient and largely practiced in secret, away from the eyes of the uninitiated. In many lands, the Old Ways have given way to new churches and temples, but druids and their followers
				still gather to honor the cycles of nature and to ensure the natural balance isn't threatened. People who dwell in or near wild lands do well to learn if a druid circle operates nearby, seeking the
				circle's blessing before hunting or farming on the lands they protect.
			</p>
			<p>
				The druid habit of gathering in clearings, wooded groves, or around sacred pools gave rise to the tradition of circles. In a circle, all are equal, and while respect is given to age and
				accomplishment, the circle reaches decisions as a whole. Those who disagree are free to argue their point, or even to leave the circle if they wish, but the circle acts as one for the good of all.
				Druid circles often include non-druid allies, such as rangers, wood elves, and the fey creatures of the land where the circle meets, all given equal voice.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Druid</h4>
			<p>
				When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith slill thrives, or was raised by a druid after being
				abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience.
				Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny. Have you always been an
				adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in
				hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

					<h4>Guiding Aspect</h4>

						Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen

						It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their
						training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs. If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual,
						and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?

				<b>Hit points at 1<sup>st</sup> level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
				<b>Hit point increase on level gain:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier
			</p>
			<h4>Proficiencies</h4>
			<p>
				<b><span class="noindent">A</span>rmor:</b> Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)<br>
				<b>Weapons:</b> Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, sickles, slings, spears (druids will not wield weapons made of metal, except sickles)<br>
				<b>Tools:</b> Herbalism kit<br>

			<h4>Equipment</h4>
			<p>

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>(a)</b> a wooden shield or <b>(b)</b> any simple weapon</li>

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every druid gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Druidic</h4>
				<p>
					You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others
					spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.
				</p>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the
					druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for druid spells. You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column
					of the Druid table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>
					The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
					all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
					You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your
					druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two
					2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
					<a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>,
					you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>
					You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for
					each spell on your list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ritual Casting</b><br>
					You can cast any druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
				</p>
				<h4>Wild Shape</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you
					finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, for example, you can transform into any
					beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

				<p>
					You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
					to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn, You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules
					apply:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill
						and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
						creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
					</li>
					<li>
						When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you
						revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you
						revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a
						spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=CallLightning"><i>Call Lightning</i></a>, that you've already
						cast.
					</li>
					<li>
						You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special
						senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
					</li>
					<li>
						You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is
						practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the
						new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<details><!--Beasts seen-->
					<summary>
						<p>
							<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix: Beasts you may have seen</b>
						</p>
					</summary>
					<p>
						When you gain Wild Shape as a 2<sup>nd</sup>-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the Monster Manual according to the
						beasts' most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2<sup>nd</sup>
						level. These tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge rating and note whether a beast
						has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.

				<h4>Wild Companion</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the
					<a href="./spells.html?l=FindFamiliar"><i>Find Familiar</i></a> spell, without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey, and the familiar disappears after a
					number of hours equal to half your druid level.
				</p>
				<h4>Cantrip Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip
					from the druid spell list.
				</p>
				<h4>Timeless Body</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.
				</p>
				<h4>Beast Spells</h4>
				<p>
					Also starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while
					in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.
				</p>
				<h4>Archdruid</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Druidic Circles</h2>
			<p>
				Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society,
				though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters.
				Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature,
				balance, and the way of the druid.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Circle of Dreams -->
				<summary><h4>Circle of Dreams</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural
					alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are
					gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Balm of the Summer Court</h4>
				<p>
					You become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your
					druid level. As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and
					add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also  gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent. You regain all expended dice when you finish a long
					rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gleaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of
					the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. While within the sphere, you and your
					allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it. The sphere
					vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.
				</p>
				<h4>Hidden Paths</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can use the hidden, magical pathways that some fey use to traverse space in the blink of an eye. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60
					feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this
					feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Walker in Dreams</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands. When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following
					spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: <a href="./spells.html?l=Dream"><i>Dream</i></a> (with you as the messenger),
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Scrying"><i>Scrying</i></a>, or <a href="./spells.html?l=TeleportationCircle"><i>Teleportation Circle</i></a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This use of <a href="./spells.html?l=TeleportationCircle"><i>Teleportation Circle</i></a> is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the
					last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted. Once you use this
					feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Circle of the Land-->
				<summary><h4>Circle of the Land</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing
					stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.
					As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.
				</p>
				<h4>Circle Spells</h4>
				<p>
					Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. You gain access to some spells connected to the
					land where you became a druid when you reach certain druid levels, as shown on the Spell tables below. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland. mountain, swamp, or
					underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you gain access to a circle spell. you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear
					on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

				<h4>Natural Recovery</h4>
				<p>
					You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature, During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
					combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
					For example, when you are a 4<sup>th</sup>-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
				</p>
				<h4>Land's Stride</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without
					taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
					movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Nature's Ward</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.
				</p>
				<h4>Nature's Sanctuary</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must
					make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature
					is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

				<p>
					Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness,
					where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid. Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one
					night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
				</p>
				<h4>Combat Wild Shape</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action. Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape. you can use a bonus action to expend one
					spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.
				</p>
				<h4>Circle Forms</h4>
				<p>
					The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. You can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you
					ignore the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there). Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as
					high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.
				</p>
				<h4>Primal Strike</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Elemental Wild Shape</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=AirElemental"><b>Air</b></a>,
					<a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=EarthElemental"><b>Earth</b></a>, <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=FireElemental"><b>Fire</b></a>, or <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=WaterElemental"><b>Water</b></a> Elemental.

				<h4>Thousand Forms</h4>

					By 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=AlterForm"><i>Alter Form</i></a> spell on yourself at will.

				<p>
					Nature is replete with a variety of mind altering substances, and it is only natural that druids would learn to utilize those substances for their own ends. While many such druids prefer to
					live solitary life as their affinity for plants overcomes their desire for sentient company, there are those who venture the world to ensure nature's wellbeing despite civilization's attempts
					at claiming the land for themselves. Often arriving in a haze of pollen or spores laced with psychoactive substances, druids of the Circle of Pollen are potent allies to those who wish to alter
					the behavior of those around them.
				</p>
				<h4>Circle Spells</h4>
				<p>
					You gain access to some spells when you reach certain druid levels, as shown on the Circle of Pollen Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and
					it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

				<h4>Plant Shape</h4>
				<p>
					You may use your Wild Shape to transform into a plant of CR1 or lower, but obeying all other rules and restrictions for assuming a Wild Shape. Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you may
					transform into a plant with a CR equal to a third of your druid level, rounded down. While in a plant shape, you are immune to the poisoned condition.
				</p>
				<h4>Pollen Burst</h4>
				<p>
					When you summon or create one or more plants, or open any number of buds, blooms, or seed pods upon a plant (including via <a href="./spells.html?l=Druidcraft"><i>Druidcraft</i></a>), as a
					reaction you may release a single burst of pollen from one point upon that plant's surface. You may also release a burst from your body as a bonus action if you are Wild Shaped into a plant
					form. When you do so, choose a creature that is neither a construct nor undead within 5 feet of the pollen outburst. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
					DC or suffer one of the following effects of your choice:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Beguiling Bloom:</i></b> The target becomes charmed by you for 1 hour and regards you as an infatuated admirer while charmed in this way. If you or your allies do anything harmful to
						the target, this effect ends. The target has advantage on the Wisdom saving throw for this effect if you or your allies are fighting it.</li>
					<li><b><i>Poisonous Vapor:</i></b> The target takes 2d6 poison damage and is <a href="./combat.html?f=Poisoned">poisoned</a> for 1 hour.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all spent uses when you complete a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Concentrated Substance</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, You have learned to concentrate the toxic substances in your pollen bursts. You gain the following additional effect options for your Pollen Burst feature.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Potent Relaxant:</i></b> The target gains one level of exhaustion.</li>
					<li><b><i>Dreadful Dander:</i></b> The target becomes frightened of you for 1 hour. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If
						the target fails 3 of these saving throws in a row, the fear cannot be ended before it has run its full duration.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Neural Spores</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, your pollen has grown increasingly potent at affecting the minds of your enemies. You gain the following additional effect options for your Pollen Burst feature.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Static Haze:</i></b> For the next 1 minute the target has disadvantage on all concentration checks it makes. In addition, if the target begins its turn concentrating on a spell, it
						must make a concentration check for that spell.</li>
					<li><b><i>Paralytic Pulse:</i></b> The target is stunned until the end of its next turn.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Aspect of the Bloom</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, by channeling your connection with plants, you can transform yourself for 1 minute into a form that is both plant and humanoid. This form can take any visual
					appearance you wish, such as causing rows of floral blooms to sprout from you in a wondrous display or making your musculature become twisting vines with leaves for hair. While in this state
					your Pollen Bursts affect all creatures within 10 feet of its origin. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Venomous Kiss</h4>
				<p>
					Also beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, Your lips carry a potent toxin which you are capable of delivering via a kiss. As an action while you are in humanoid, plant, or Aspect of the Bloom
					forms, you may make a melee attack roll (+(Strength modifier + proficiency bonus) to hit) against a creature. On a hit the attack deals 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier poison damage and the target
					must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure the target suffers an additional 5d10 poison damage and becomes poisoned. You may use this feature a number of
					times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You regain all spent uses when you finish a long rest.

				<h4>Restored Shape</h4>
				<p>
					While you are more than capable of Wild Shaping yourself, you prefer to wild shape others, tuning them to the animal within and unleashing their true nature as it was meant to be.
					As an action you may use one of your uses of the Wild Shape feature to transform a willing humanoid creature you're touching. The rules for this transformation match those you would follow
					when transforming yourself using Wild Shape, but apply to the chosen creature instead. A transformed creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of its turn, 
					ending the transformation on a success. You can also end the transformation at any time (no action required).
				</p>
				<p>
					When you cast a druid spell, a creature you have transformed with this trait may deliver that spell. All ranges for that spell are determined starting from that creature, but it still uses your
					wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus.
				</p>
				<h4>Mythical Shape</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your Restored Shape to transform another creature, you may transform that creature into a Dragon, Elemental, or Monstrosity instead of a Beast.
					The chosen creature must still follow all movement speed and CR restrictions of your Wild Shape.
				</p>
				<h4>Empowered Shaping</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, You have mastered channeling your druidic magics into the creature you return to its primal nature. When you transform another creature using your Restored Shape, you 
					may expend 2 uses of the Wild Shape instead. If you do, the maximum CR for the creature you transform the target into is a fifth of your druid level, rounded down. Additionally, you can
					communicate with the transformed creature as though it is under the effect of a <a href="./spells.html?f=BeastBond"><i>Beast Bond</i></a> spell cast by you for as long as it remains transformed.
				</p>
				<h4>Imbue Instinct</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, as part of shifting a creature to your desired Pet Shape form, you may instill in them a greater animalistic instinct. When you use your Restored Shape to
					transform another creature, you may choose one of the below benefits to apply to them for the duration of their transformation.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Predator:</i></b> The creature has advantage on attack rolls, and may use a bonus action to make a melee attack using one of its natural weapons. It also has advantage on Wisdom
						(Perception) checks.</li>
					<li><b><i>Prey:</i></b> The creature gains +2 AC, and has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws. It also has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks</li>

				<p>
					Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living
					things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as
					their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred
					to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. Members of this circle become
					adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the
					wilderness are with them.
				</p>
				<h4>Speech of the Woods</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to
					convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can
					combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Totem</h4>
				<p>
					you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit
					creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. As a bonus action, you
					can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see. The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
					short or long rest. The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bear:</b><br>
					The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In
					addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Hawk:</b><br>
					The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to 
					grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Unicorn:</b><br>
					The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition. if you use a spell
					slot to cast a spell that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.
				</p>
				<h4>Mighty Summoner</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, beasts and fey that you conjure are more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The creature appears with more hit points than normal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it has.</li>
					<li>The damage from its natural weapons is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Guardian Spirit</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic. When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with a spell ends its
					turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to half your druid level.
				</p>
				<h4>Faithful Summons</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will,
					you can immediately gain the benefits of <a href="./spells.html?l=ConjureAnimals"><i>Conjure Animals</i></a> as if it were cast using a 9th-level spell slot. It summons four beasts of your choice
					that are challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The spell lasts for
					1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

				<summary><h4>Circle of Spores</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids
					believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a
					new form. Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these
					druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final
					rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.
				</p>
				<h4>Circle Spells</h4>
				<p>
					Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=ChillTouch"><i>Chill Touch</i></a>
					cantrip. You gain access to some spells when you reach certain druid levels, as shown on the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it
					prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid

				<h4>Halo of Spores</h4>
				<p>
					You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts
					its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases
					to 1d6 at 6<sup>th</sup> level, 1d8 at 10<sup>th</sup> level, and 1d10 at 14<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Symbiotic Entity</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you
					gain 4 temporary hit points for each of your druid levels. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.</li>
					<li>Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all the temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.
				</p>
				<h4>Fungal Infestation</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your
					reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Zombie"><b>Zombie</b></a> stat block. In combat, the zombie's turn comes
					immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it
					collapses and dies. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Spreading Spores</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 30 feet away, where
					they swirl in a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. The spores disappear early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss them as a bonus action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no longer
					active. Whenever a creature moves into the cube or starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your
					spell save DC. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn. While the cube of spores persists, you can't use your Halo of Spores reaction.
				</p>
				<h4>Fungal Body</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, the fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead,
					unless you're incapacitated.

					The Circle of the Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By
					revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos. Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the stars' effects
					on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids,
					petroglyphs, and underground temples—any construction durable enough to protect the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.

					You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. You determine what this star map looks like. While
					holding your star map, you have these benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You know the <a href="./spells.html?l=Guidance"><i>Guidance</i></a> cantrip</li>
					<li>You have the <a href="./spells.html?l=GuidingBolt"><i>Guiding Bolt</i></a> spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have
						prepared</li>
					<li>You can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=GuidingBolt"><i>Guiding Bolt</i></a> without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
						expended uses when you finish a long rest</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.
				</p>
				<h4>Starry Form</h4>
				<p>
					As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast. While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics,
					but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an
					additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. Whenever you assume your starry form,
					choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Archer:</b><br>
					A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous
					arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Chalice:</b><br>
					A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can
					regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Dragon:</b><br>
					A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or
					lower on the d20 as a 10.
				</p>
				<h4>Cosmic Omen</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a
					special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Weal (even):</b><br>
					Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to
					the total.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Woe (odd):</b><br>
					Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled
					from the total.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Twinkling Constellations</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet
					and can hover. Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.
				</p>
				<h4>Full of Stars</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, while in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Circle of Wildfires -->
				<summary><h4>Circle of Wildfires</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Druids within the Circle of Wildfires understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit
					that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.
				</p>
				<h4>Circle Spells</h4>
				<p>
					You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a primal being of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain druid levels, as
					shown on the Circle of Wildfires Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each
					day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

						<b><i>Flame Seed:</i></b> <i>Ranged Weapon Attack:</i> your spell attack modifier to hit, range 60 ft, one target you can see. <i>Hit:</i> 1d6 + your Proficiency Bonus fire damage.
					</p>
					<p class="blackwash">
						<b><i>Fiery Teleportation:</i></b> The spirit and each willing creature of your choice within 5 feet of it teleport up to 15 feet to unoccupied spaces you can see. Then each creature
						within 5 feet of the space that the spirit left must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 + your Proficiency Bonus fire damage
					</p>
				</details>
				<p>
					You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form. The spirit
					appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity
					saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus in several
					places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire. In
					combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your
					turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
					The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.
				</p>
				<h4>Enhanced Bond</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points
					while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range
					other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.
				</p>
				<h4>Cauterizing Flames</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to turn death into magical flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small or larger creature dies within 30 feet of you or your wildfire spirit,
					a harmless spectral flame springs forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there for 1 minute. When a creature you can see enters that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish the
					spectral flame there and either heal the creature or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your
					proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Blazing Revival</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, the bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from death. If the spirit is within 120 feet of you when you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall
					unconscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit points. You then regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
					finish a long rest.

				<summary><h4>The Skinwalkers</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:40%;" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/skinwalker.jpeg">
				<p><i>NOTE: This is an untested homebrew class and I can not guarantee its balance at all. everything here is subject to change if I ever find a problem with it.</i></p>
				<p>
					The skinwalkers, or "those who walk on four legs", are a reclusive and malicious circle dedicated not to the protection of the wilds, but to the destruction of civilization. They sow fear and
					paranoia, and spread disease wherever they go. Becoming a skinwalker requires showing your dedication to the cause through the live sacrifice of a close family member, such as a sibling, parent,
					or grandparent.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you choose this subclass, think about what drove your character to this point. What made them hate civilization, or people in general, to such an extent that they would sacrifice their own
					family for this dark power? Were you part of a simple, savage tribe that was devastated by a civilized invader, to the point where you saw no option but to sacrifice family for a chance at
					revenge? Did your family abuse you? Perhaps because of a rigid civilized societal structure that you just couldn't conform to for one reason or another? Whatever the case, noone becomes a
					Skinwalker without being malicious, letting their hatred and anger define them to a large extent.
				</p>
				<h4>Myriad Voices</h4>
				<p>
					You can perfectly mimic any voice or animal sound. In order to imitate a language you do not understand, you must first have heard the words you want uttered, and you still don't understand them.
				</p>
				<h4>Tools of the Wicked</h4>
				<p>
					A Skinwalker relies on two special items to perform their dark arts.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Accursed Bones:</b><br>
					As part of the initiation ritual, the Skinwalker's sacrifice is turned into a tool for their magic. Their skin is woven into a bag, and their bones are ground into a powder that is placed 
					therein. This bag is your spellcasting focus, and you can't cast spells without it. The bag can be taken from you, but has an uncanny knack for finding its way back to you. Should the bag
					be emptied or destroyed, you can replace it with materials from a new live sacrifice, which takes 3 days. The new sacrifice doesn't have to be a close relative, or even someone you know.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Guise of the Beast:</b><br>
					Every skinwalker has a sort of hooded cloak made from a sacrificed animal's skin, which they fuse to themselves to attain a more versatile Wild Shape. Which animal the cloak comes from is
					entirely irrelevant, but you can't use Wild Shape without wearing it. Should you lose the cloak, you can replace it by sacrificing another animal and reappropriating its skin, which takes
					36 hours. When you use Wild Shape, the following special rules apply to you:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You don't assume the Beast's hit points, hit dice, or constitution score. Any damage dealt to you while in animal form is dealt directly to you and cannot revert your shape, unless it
						kills you.</li>
					<li>Your equipment always merges into your new form. If you want your beast form to wear any armor, you have to put it on afterwards, and any such equipment either bursts apart or falls to the
						ground as appropriate when you revert to your normal shape.</li>
					<li>You can speak, cast spells, and even wield weapons in your beast form, as the cloak allows you to partially reverse your transformation. Your Accursed Bones must be merged into your beast
						form in order for you to cast spells.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Transfixing Terror</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, if you're looking a humanoid in the eye, you can use your action to force them to make a wisdom saving throw vs. your spellcasting DC. A creature makes this
					saving throw with disadvantage if both it and you are in dim light or darkness, or surrounded by forest. A creature that fails this throw is <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Paralyzed">paralyzed</a>, as utter terror has it frozen in place.
					This effect lasts until you look away. If the creature takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw with advantage to end the paralysis. If the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw
					from darkness or foliage as mentioned earlier, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out as normal. A creature for which the paralysis failed to take effect or ended cannot be
					transfixed again for 24 hours. If you attempt to attack any creature other than the transfixed creature, you have disadvantage on that attack roll, as you cannot focus on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While transfixing a creature, you can use your Wild Shape to assume the form of that creature. Your new form looks exactly like the transfixed creature, clothes and accessories notwithstanding,
					as your equipment merges into the new form as normal. You learn that creature's surface memories, it's name, age, occupation, family members, and close friends, if any. You assume none of that
					creature's statistics, skills, or features, and can only stay in its shape for as long as you can stay in animal form.
				</p>
				<h4>Wandering Epedemic</h4>
				<!-- This feature may or may not be too broken. there should probably be a spell slot requirement or a random element to the diseases -->
				<p>
					Staring at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you cannot be tracked by any means unless you allow it. In addition, you can use your Accursed Bones and expend a spell slot to curse one creature within 30ft
					of you. After 1d4 days, the curse fades and that creature starts showing symptoms of a disease of your choice. By expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can instead target a chimney,
					cursing all creatures asleep inside the house.
				</p>
				<h4>Devour Fear</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can feed off the fear you spread to replenish your dark powers. If you are transfixing a creature, you can end the paralysis on that creature to recover
					a spell slot of 3rd level or lower, or a use of Wild Shape. You can only replenish spell slots with a total level of 3 with this feature, after which you must finish a long rest to use this
					feature again.
				</p>
				<h4>Wicked Bond</h4>
				<!-- Hooray for extra featuress since beast spells are obsolete for this subclass -->
				<p>
					By 18<sup>th</sup> level, you have formed a dark bond with your Tools of the Wicked. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to instantly teleport your Accursed Bones or Guise of the Beast to
					you. This teleportation drapes you in the guise, letting you wear it without having to go through the motions of donning it. If either item is destroyed, this teleportation doesn't repair them,
					bringing you only their powerless husks.

		<div class="container" id="Fighter">
			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/2460565.jpg">
			<h2>Fighter</h2>
			<p>
				A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his
				exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.
			</p>
			<p>
				A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding
				whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
			</p>
			<p>
				A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's
				sword fiares with blue light an instant beforc she sends lightning fiashing forth to smite him.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of D&amp;D. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
				mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death,
				both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.
			</p>
			<h4>Well-Rounded Specialists</h4>
			<p>
				Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence wilh a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of
				skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery,
				some on fighting with two weapons aI once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior
				combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
			</p>
			<h4>Trained for Danger</h4>
			<p>
				Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran
				soldiers, mililary officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters. Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster
				slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life they left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much
				greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&amp;D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the
				same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same
				basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Fighter</h4>
			<p>
				As you build your fighter, think about two related elements ofyour character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were
				you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a
				thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors. You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy,
				learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you
				following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. Or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them.
				Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.

						Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the

					<h4>Heraldic Sign</h4>

						Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a
						heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one’s self—interest. Your character could be affiliated
						with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that’s not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature
						or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.

					<h4>Instructor</h4>
					<p>
						Some fighters are natural—born combatants who have a talent for surviving in battle. Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a
						military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group. A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one—on-one instruction from
						an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student’s background. If you decide that your
						character had an individual instructor, What is that person's specialty? Do you emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you take the instructor’s teachings and adapt them to your

					<h4>Signature Style</h4>
					<p>
						Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a
						fighter's personality, that's not always the case—someones approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line. Do you have a
						combat style that mirrors your outlook on life, or is something else inside you unleashed when weapons are drawn?

			<h4>Quick Build</h4>
			<p>
				You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. first, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons ar on archery (or
				finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Arcane Archer, Eldritch Knight, or Psi Warrior martial archetypes. Second, choose the
				soldier background.

				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
				<p>
					You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Your options are detailed at the bottom of this page. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to
					choose again.
				</p>
				<h4>Second Wind</h4>
				<p>
					You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you
					use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Action Surge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action. Once you use this

					can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level and three times between long rests starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level.

			<h2>Subclasses: Martial Archetypes</h2>
			<p><i>So there are different names for different sorts of people who swing swords? Why? Let me try: Big sword swinger and tiny sword swinger. No, that sounds like it's the size of the sword that matters.
				How about big meatbag with a sword and little meatbag with a sword?</i><br></p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Arcane Archer -->
				<summary><h4>Arcane Archer</h4></summary>
				<p>
					An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They
					stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over
					the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned and adapted by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with marksmanship.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Archer Lore</h4>
				<p>
					You learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature—typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and
					you choose to learn either the <a href="./spells.html?l=Prestidigitation"><i>Prestidigitation</i></a> or the <a href="./spells.html?l=Druidcraft"><i>Druidcraft</i></a> cantrip.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Shot</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see “Arcane Shot Options” below). Once per
					turn when you fire ammunition as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that shot. You decide to use the option when the ammunition hits a creature, unless
					the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional Arcane Shot
					option of your choice when you reach 7<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> level. Each option also improves when you become an 18<sup>th</sup>-level fighter.
				</p>
				<h4>Magic Missiles</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to infuse ammunition with magic. Whenever you fire nonmagical ammunition, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
					immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.
				</p>
				<h4>Curving Shot</h4>
				<p>
					Also at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with magic ammunition and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the
					attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.
				</p>
				<h4>Ever-ready Shot</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your magical marksmanship is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.
				</p>
				<div> <!-- Arcane Shot options -->
					<h4>Arcane Shot Options</h4>
					<p>
						The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with
						one of the schools of magic. If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
					</p>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Banishing Shot</b></summary>
						You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the shot must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
						While banished in this way, the target's speed is 0, and it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if
						that space is occupied. After you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the shot hits it.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Beguiling Shot</b></summary>
						Your enchantment magic causes this shot to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of
						the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the
						charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Bursting Shot</b></summary>
						You imbue your shot with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other
						creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each. The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Enfeebling Shot</b></summary>
						You weave necromantic magic into your shot. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage
						dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn. The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Grasping Shot</b></summary>
						When this shot strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its
						speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use
						its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.
						The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Piercing Shot</b></summary>
						You use transmutation magic to give your shot an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the ammunition shoots forward in a line,
						which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
						failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the ammunition, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. The piercing damage
						increases to 2d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Seeking Shot</b></summary>
						Using divination magic, you grant your shot the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have
						seen in the past minute. The ammunition flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's
						range and there is a path large enough for the ammunition to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it
						can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the ammunition, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the
						target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location. The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Shadow Shot</b></summary>
						You weave illusion magic into your shot, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a
						Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18<sup>th</sup> level.
					</details>
				</div>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Banneret -->
				<summary><h4>Banneret</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/banneret.jpg">
				<p>
					A Banneret inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a banneret in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone
					banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band. A banneret prefers to lead through deeds,
					not words. As one spearheads an attack, their actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had. A banneret might be a brave knight rallying
					support for her king, a bandit chief with a loyal gang, or a fearsome warlord leading his armies to glory and conquest.
				<h4>Rallying Cry</h4>
				<p>
					You can inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one
					regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.
				</p>
				<h4>Convincing Negotiator</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling,
					Insight, Intimidation, or Performance. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Persuasion. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you
					gain from this feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Inspiring Surge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged
					weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you. Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one.
				</p>
				<h4>Bulwark</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma
					saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can
					reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Battle Master -->
				<summary><h4>Battle Master</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond
					battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are
					well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.
				</p>
				<h4>Combat Superiority</h4>
				<p>
					You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The DC for this
					saving throw is 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Maneuvers:</b> You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" at the bottom of this page. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one
					maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup> level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one
					maneuver you know with a different one.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Superiority Dice:</b> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or
					long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7<sup>th</sup> level and one more at 15<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Student of War</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.
				</p>
				<h4>Know Your Enemy</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared
					to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strength score</li>
					<li>Dexterity score</li>
					<li>Constitution score</li>
					<li>Armor Class</li>
					<li>Current hit points</li>
					<li>Total class levels (if any)</li>
					<li>Fighter Class levels (if any)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Improved Combat Superiority</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18<sup>th</sup> level, they turn into d12s.
				</p>
				<h4>Relentless</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Cavalier -->
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:35%; margin-top:-1em;" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/cavalier.JPG">
				<summary><h4>Cavalier</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state
					dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many
					of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
				<p>
					you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice. At your
					DM's discretion, you may also gain a warhorse (or another mount), if you don't already own one.
				</p>
				<h4>Born to the Saddle</h4>
				<p>
					Your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on
					your feet if you're not incapacitated. Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
				</p>
				<h4>Unwavering Mark</h4>
				<P>
					You can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next
					turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack
					roll that doesn't target you.
				</P>
				<p>
					In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You
					have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attacks weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level. Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can
					make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Warding Maneuver</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can
					roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has
					resistance against the attack's damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a
					long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Hold the Line</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit
					a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Ferocious Charger</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it
					with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked <a href="./combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a>. You can use this feature only once on each of
					your turns.
				</p>
				<h4>Vigilant Defender</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your own.
					You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Champion -->
				<summary><h4>Champion</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/18558867.jpg">
				<p>
					The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical
					excellence to deal devastating blows
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Critical</h4>
				<p>
					Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your weapon attacks score a criticaI hit on a roll of 18-20.
				</p>
				<h4>Remarkable Athlete</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.
					In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Additional Fighting Style</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Survivor</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more
					than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

						or long rest.</li>

				<p>
					The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards,
					They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal
					damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
				</p>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					You augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the
					wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for wizard spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10<sup>th</sup> level.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level
					or higher. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=Shield"><i>Shield</i></a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast it using either
					slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells known of 1st level and higher</b><br>
					You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch
					Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st-level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for
					which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spells you learn at 8<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 20<sup>th</sup> level (marked with an asterisk on the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table) can come from any school of magic. Whenever
					you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you
					have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, or 20<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Weapon Bond</h4>
				<p>
					You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within
					your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus
					action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a
					third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
				</p>
				<h4>War Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
				</p>
				<h4>Eldritch Strike</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level,you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage
					on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Charge</h4>
				<p>
					At 15<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional
					action.
				</p>
				<h4>Improved War Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

				<summary><h4>Psi Warrior</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki
					train to become such warriors, as do some of the most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming Psi Warriors. As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed
					your psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.
				</p>
				<h4>Psionic Power</h4>
				<p>
					You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are d6s. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency
					bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You
					regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you
					finish a short or long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5<sup>th</sup> level (d8), 11<sup>th</sup> level (d10), and
					17<sup>th</sup> level (d12). The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Protective Field:</b><br>
					When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic Energy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number
					rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1 ), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Psionic Strike:</b><br>
					You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can
					expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Telekinetic Movement:</b><br>
					You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target
					and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you
					can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it
					again.
				</p>
				<h4>Telekinetic Adept</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you have master new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Psi-Powered Leap:</b><br>
					As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you
					can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Telekinetic Thrust:</b><br>
					When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
					If the save fails, you can knock the target <a href="./combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a> or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.
				</p>
				<h4>Guarded Mind</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, the psionic energy flowing through you bolsters your mind. You have resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or frightened, you
					can expend a Psionic Energy die and end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those conditions.
				</p>
				<h4>Bulwark of Force</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see within 30 feet
					of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you're
					incapacitated. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Telekinetic Master</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. You can cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Telekinesis"><i>Telekinesis</i></a> spell,
					requiring no components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you concentrate on the spell, including the turn when you cast it, you can make
					one attack with a weapon as a bonus action. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to cast it
					again.

				<summary><h4>Rune Knight</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you
					likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant
					in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.

				<h4>Rune Carver</h4>
				<p>
					You can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you
					know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can
					touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a
					shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.
					If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Giant's Might</h4>
				<p>
					You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.</li>
					<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
					<li>Once on each of your turns, one of your weapon attacks can deal an extra 1d6 damage of its type to a target on a hit.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Runic Shield</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction
					to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long
					rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Great Stature</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, the magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll. Moreover, the extra
					damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to 1d8.
				</p>
				<h4>Master of Runes</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Runic Juggernaut</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you
					use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.
				</p>
				<div> <!-- Runes -->
					<h4>Rune Options</h4>
					<p>
						The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune.
					</p>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Cloud Rune</b></summary>
						This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and
						Charisma (Deception) checks. In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a
						different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects
						regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">

						extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a> for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each
						of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a
						short or long rest.

						This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and
						you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the
						creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is <a href="./combat.html?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>,
						descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until

				<summary><h4>Samurai</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A Samurai's resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a Samurai's path have two choices: yield or
					die fighting.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiency</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
				</p>
				<h4>Fighting Spirit</h4>
				<p>
					Your intensity in battle can shield you and help you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When
					you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 10 at 10<sup>th</sup> level and 15 at
					15<sup>th</sup> level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Elegant Courtier</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check
					equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence
					or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
				</p>
				<h4>Tireless Spirit</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.
				</p>
				<h4>Rapid Strike</h4>
				<p>
					At 15<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo
					the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Strength before Death</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction
					to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving
					throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you
					can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

			<h2>Monk</h2>
			<p>
				Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them,
				knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling. until at last she stands alone.
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving wilh the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of
				its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.
			</p>
			<p>
				Monks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly combatants, their abilities on a
				par with those of a raging barbarian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of all monastic study. By coming to know oneself completely,
				one learns much of the wider world. A monk's focus on inner mastery leads many such individuals to become detached from society, more concerned with their personal experience than with happenings
				elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed of an already rare type of character, taking their quest for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the world at large.
			</p>
			<h4>The Magic of Ki</h4>
			<p>
				Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through
				living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in
				their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power
				over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.
			</p>
			<h4>Training and Asceticism</h4>
			<p>
				Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection
				through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some
				kindness that the monks had performed for their families. Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others
				are sworn to isolalion, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up
				protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants. For a monk, bccoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifstyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks
				don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care
				little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Monk</h4>
			<p>
				As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's
				threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the
				monastic life for yourself?
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violalion of the community's
				rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a
				monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

					<h4>Monastery</h4>
					<p>
						A monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the exception of adventurers
						and others who have reason to leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source of support in times of need. What sort of place
						was your monastery, and where is it located? Did attending it contribute to your experience in an unusual or distinctive way?

					<h4>Monastic Icon</h4>

						Even in the monastic lifestyle, which eschews materialism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an important part in defining the identity of an order. Some monastic orders treat certain
						creatures with special regard, either because the creature is tied to the orders history or because it serves as an example of a quality the monks seek to emulate. If your character's
						monastery had a special icon, you might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identifying mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not
						have a physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a posture that you adopt, and which other monks might know how to interpret.

				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
				<p>
					While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Martial Arts</h4>
				<p>
					Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or
					heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
					<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>
					<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack
						with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a
					shorter, straighter blade (called a kama), Whatever name you use for a monk weapon. you can use the game statistics provided on the items page.
				</p>
				<h4>Dedicated Weapon</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can
					touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again. The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.</li>
					<li>You must be proficient with it.</li>
					<li>It must lack the heavy and special properties.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Ki</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the
					number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table, You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,
					Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of
					the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. This DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus
					+ your Wisdom modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Flurry of Blows</b>
					Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.<br><br>
				</p>

					<b>Patient Defense</b>
					You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Step of the Wind</b>
					You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>Unarmored Movement</h4>
				<p>
					Also starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the
					Monk table. At 9<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
				</p>
				<h4>Deflect Missiles</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is
					reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one
					hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60ft) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same
					reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.
				</p>
				<h4>Ki-Fueled Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Also starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action
					before the end of the turn.

					stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Stunned">stunned</a> until the end of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Focused Aim</h4>
				<p>
					Finally, beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially
					turning the miss into a hit.
				</p>
				<h4>Ki-Empowered Strike</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
				</p>

					lightning breath or a <a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
					you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

					and take the second result.

				</table>
				<p>
					Monks who practice the Way of the Arcane Hand have trained their bodies and souls to be attuned to the weave of arcane magic. They can harness those cosmic energies and use them to fuel their
					martial practices. 
				</p>
				<h4>Erudite Education</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. Whenever you make an Intelligence ability check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
				</p>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					You augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the
					wizard spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for wizard spells learned this way, since you learn your spells through contemplation and meditation.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Arcane Focus</b><br>
					You can use a monk weapon as an arcane focus for your spellcasting.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10<sup>th</sup> level.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's
					level or higher. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=Thunderwave"><i>Thunderwave</i></a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
					it using either slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells known of 1st level and higher</b><br>
					You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st-level or higher.
					Spells you learn must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br>
					Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell you can cast of your choice from the wizard spell list.
				</p>
				<h4>Eldritch Flurry</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the following features for your spellcasting:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.</li>
					<li>When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action instead of making unarmed strikes.</li>
					<li>When you use your action to cast a spell, you may treat this as taking an attack with a monk weapon for the purposes of your other monk features</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Arcane Empowerment</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, while you are concentrating on a spell, you add twice the spell's level to the damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and attacks made with monk weapons.
				</p>
				<h4>Focus Power</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell, you can expend ki points to increase the level of the spell as if you'd cast the spell using a higher-level spell slot. You must use a
					spell slot as normal to cast the spell, then expend 1 ki point for each level you increase the spell in this way. You can increase the spell's level higher than your highest-level spell slot,
					to a maximum level equal to your proficiency bonus.<br>
					For example, if you're an 11th-level Way of the Arcane Hand monk, when you cast <a href="./spells.html?l=ScorchingRay"><i>Scorching Ray</i></a> using a 2nd-level spell slot, you could expend 2 ki
					points to cast it as 4th-level spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Spell Resistance</h4>
				<p>
					Also starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, as well as resistance to damage from spells and magical effects.
				</p>
				<h4>Meditative Casting</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action that requires your concentration, you can expend ki points equal to the spell's level to modify the spell
					so that it does not require your concentration. Instead, the spell lasts up to 1 minute, or its maximum duration, whichever is shorter.

				<p>
					The dragon god Bahamut is known to travel the Material Plane in the guise of a young monk, and legend says that he founded the first monastery of the Way of the Ascendant Dragon in this guise.
					The fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic
					might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. But all this power is in service of a greater
					goal: achieving a spiritual unity with the essence of the Material Plane.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a follower of the Way of the Ascendant Dragon, you decide how you unlocked the power of dragons within yourself. The Ascendant Dragon Origin table offers a number of possibilities.
				</p>
				<h4>Draconic Disciple</h4>
				<p>
					You can channel draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your unarmed strikes with the essence of a dragon's breath, giving you the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Tounge of Tragons:</b> You learn to read, speak, and write Draconic. If you already know Draconic, you instead learn one other language of your choice.</li>
					<li><b>Draconic Strike:</b> When you damage a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.</li>
					<li><b>Draconic Presence:</b> If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check, as you tap into the mighty presence of dragons.
						Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Breath of the Dragon</h4>
				<p>
					You can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of
					draconic energy in either a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in that area must make a
					Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At
					11<sup>th</sup> level, the damage of this feature increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 2 ki

				</p>
				<h4>Wings Unfurled</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a
					flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Aspect of the Wyrm</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 11<sup>th</sup> level, the power of your draconic spirit radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of
					draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the effects below of your choice. Once you create this aura, you can't create it again until you
					finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to create it again.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Frightful Presence:</b><br>
					When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC or
					become <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Resistance:</b><br>
					Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Ascendant Aspect</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Augment Breath:</b><br>
					When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend 1 ki point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet
					wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Blindsight:</b><br>
					You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible
					creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Explosive Fury:</b><br>
					When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving
					throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).

				<summary><h4>Way of the Astral Self</h4></summary>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Forms of Your Astral Self</i></h4>
					<p>
						The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't
						necessarily look a nything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur—the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk
						might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known
						more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.
					</p>
					<p>
						When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in
						the form of your astral self.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to
					be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to
					the mighty.
				</p>
				<h4>Arms of the Astral Self</h4>
				<p>
					Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of
					your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. For 10 minutes, these spectral arms
					hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die. While the spectral arms are present, you
					gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
					<li>You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.</li>
					<li>When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal</li>
					<li>The damage you deal with unarmed strikes you make with the arms is force damage.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Visage of the Astral Self</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can summon the visage of your astral self. As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1
					ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die. The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance. While
					the spectral visage is present, you gain the following benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Astral Sight:</b><br>
					You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Wisdom of the Spirit:</b><br>
					You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Word of the Spirit:</b><br>
					When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your
					voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.
				</p>
				<h4>Body of the Astral Self</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, when you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers
					your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance. While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Deflect Energy:</b><br>
					When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier
					(minimum reduction of 1).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Empowered Arms:</b><br>
					Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.
				</p>
				<h4>Awakened Astral Self</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage,
					and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die. While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Armor of the Spirit:</b><br>
					You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Astral Barrage:</b><br>
					Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.
				</p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Way of the Drunken Master -->
				<summary><h4>Way of the Drunken Master</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like
					an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master's erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats. A drunken
					master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful
					foe.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also
					gain proficiency with brewer’s supplies if you don’t already have it.
				</p>
				<h4>Drunken Technique</h4>
				<p>
					You learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10
					feet until the end of the current turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Tipsy Sway</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Leap to Your Feet:</b><br>
					When you’re prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Redirect Attack:</b><br>
					When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see
					within 5 feet of you.
				</p>
				<h4>Drunkard's Luck</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll,
					you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.
				</p>
				<h4>Intoxicated Frenzy</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional
					attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.

				<p>
					You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will,
					using them as an extension of your body, Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together. Many monks of this tradition tattoo their
					bodies with representations of their ki powers. Commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains. and cresting waves.
				</p>
				<h4>Disciple of the Elements</h4>
				<p>
					you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one
					other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, and 17<sup>th</sup> level.
					Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Elemental Attunement</b><br>
					You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces nearby, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

					<li>Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour</li>

					Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it. Once you
					reach 5<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect
					at a higher level, as for example <a href="./spells.html?l=BurningHands"><i>Burning Hands</i></a> does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you
					are a 5<sup>th</sup>-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=BurningHands"><i>Burning Hands</i></a>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell
					(the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1). The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you
					spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.
				</p>
				<h4>Elemental Disciplines</h4>
				<p>
					Only a handful of spells are represented here. When you gain an elemental discipline, your DM might allow you to learn any other element-associated spell—or other spells if you can justify them,
					like in Clench of the North Wind—with the stipulation that you cannot learn a spell of a higher level than you could cast using your ki points, as per the Spells and Ki Points table. Casting a
					spell costs you a number of Ki points equal to the spell's level + 1.

				<summary><h4>Way of the Kensei</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of the Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has
					expanded to include many different weapons. A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used
					to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.
				</p>
				<h4>Path of the Kensei</h4>
				<p>
					Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following
					benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Kensei Weapons:</b><br>
					Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special
					properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this
					tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, and 17<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—either
					melee or ranged—to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Agile Parry:</b><br>
					If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC
					until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Kensei's Shot:</b><br>
					You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra
					1d4 damage of the weapons type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Way of the Brush:</b><br>
					You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies.
				</p>
				<h4>One with the Blade</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Magic Kensei Weapon:</b><br>
					Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Deft Strike:</b><br>
					When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature
					only once on each of your turns.
				</p>
				<h4>Sharpen the Blade</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to
					attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect
					on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.
				</p>
				<h4>Unerring Accuracy</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use
					this feature only once on each of your turns.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Way of the Long Death -->
				<summary><h4>Way of the Long Death</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments
					of their demise. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.
				</p>
				<h4>Touch of Death</h4>
				<p>
					Your study of death allows you to extract vitality from another creature as it nears its demise. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points
					equal to your Wisdom modifier + your monk level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
				</p>
				<h4>Hour of Reaping</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to unsettle or terrify those around you as an action, for your soul has been touched by the shadow of death. When you take this action, each
					creature within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw vs. your ki save DC or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you until the end of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Mastery of Death</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 11<sup>th</sup> level, you use your familiarity with death to escape its grasp. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 ki point (no action required) to have 1 hit
					point instead.
				</p>
				<h4>Touch of the Long Death</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 ki points. The
					target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per ki point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Way of Mercy -->
				<summary><h4>Way of Mercy</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help,
					they bring a swift end as an act of mercy. Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order, administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality rather
					than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities, while others might be masked bringers of macabre mercies. The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep
					cowls, and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death.

				<h4>Implements of Mercy</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skills, and you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit. You also gain a special mask, which you often wear when using the features of this
					subclass. You determine its appearance, or generate it randomly by rolling on the Merciful Mask table.
				</p>
				<h4>Hand of Healing</h4>
				<p>
					Your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom
					modifier. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the healing.
				</p>
				<h4>Hand of Harm</h4>
				<p>
					You use your ki to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom
					modifier. You can use this feature only once per turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Physician's Touch</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can administer even greater cures with a touch, and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your knowledge to cause harm. When you use Hand of Healing on a
					creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you
					can subject that creature to the <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Poisoned">poisoned</a> condition until the end of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Flurry of Healing and Harm</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hand of Healing, without
					spending ki points for the healing. In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the ki point for Hand of Harm.
					You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Hand of Ultimate Mercy</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5
					ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d 10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it
					revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images4.alphacoders.com/110/110584.jpg">
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage
					to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.
				</p>
				<h4>Open Hand Technique</h4>
				<p>
					You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on
					that target:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked <a href="./combat.html?f=Prone">prone</a>.</li>
					<li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
					<li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Wholeness of Body</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this
					feature again.
				</p>
				<h4>Tranquility</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 11<sup>th</sup> level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Sanctuary"><i>Sanctuary</i></a> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell is equal to
					your ki save DC.
				</p>
				<h4>Quivering Palm</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike. you can spend 3 ki points to start these
					imperceptible vibrations. which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. <span title="Omae wa mou shindeiru">The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them.</span>
					To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points.
					If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Way of the Serpent -->
				<summary><h4>Way of Serpent</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Masters of the spear, monks of the Way of the Serpent use polearms not only as a weapon, but as an extension of themselves, using their weapon to amplify mobility, maneuverability, and combat.
					Like a snake in the grass, the Way of the Serpent hones one's ability to predict oncoming attacks, deflect from a distance, and strike with deadly precision
				</p>
				<h4>Serpent Style</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with the glaive, halberd, pike, trident, and similar spears and polearms. These weapons count as monk weapons for you, even if they have the heavy or two-handed properties.
					Furthermore, your grace and mastery of these weapons does not limit your ability to make unarmed strikes while wielding a two-handed weapon. While you are wielding a quarterstaff or trident in
					two hands, that weapon gains the Reach property.
				</p>
				<h4>Serpent Sting</h4>
				<p>
					You can use polearm weapons to vault into the air. While you are wielding a weapon with the Reach property, your jump distance is doubled. While wielding a weapon with the Reach property, when
					you expend a ki point to use your Step of the Wind feature, your jump distance is instead tripled for the turn, and you gain advantage on your next melee weapon attack you make this turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Serpent Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn the following techniques to augment your attacks:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Cobra Strike:</i></b> When a creature you can see moves into your reach, you can use your reaction to make one attack against that creature.</li>
					<li><b><i>Python Strike:</i></b> When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can also use your Stunning Strike on that attack without expending a ki point.</li>
					<li><b><i>Viper Strike:</i></b> Once on your turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 or more ki points, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus. The
						attack deals 1d6 poison damage, plus 1d6 additional poison damage per ki point spent, and the target is <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Poisoned">poisoned</a> until the end of your next turn.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Serpent Stances</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, at the start of your turn, you can adopt a serpent stance (no action required). When you do, choose one of the following serpent stances, which last until you
					are incapacitated or use this feature again.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Anaconda Stance:</i></b> While using this stance, increase the reach of your melee weapon attacks and unarmed strikes by 10 feet.</li>
					<li><b><i>Black Mamba Stance:</i></b> While using this stance, once per turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you may make an additional melee attack as part of the same action.</li>
					<li><b><i>Couatl Stance:</i></b> While using this stance, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
					<li><b><i>Marilith Stance:</i></b> While using this stance, you can take one reaction on every turn in combat, instead of once each round.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Supreme Serpent</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, when you adopt a Serpent Stance, you can instead adopt two serpent stances at the same time, gaining the benefits of both effects
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Way of Shadow -->
				<summary><h4>Way of Shadow</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the
					members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to
					nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.
				</p>
				<h4>Shadow Arts</h4>
				<p>
					You can use your ki to replicate the effects of certain spells. As an action. you can spend 2 ki points to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=Darkness"><i>Darkness</i></a>,
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Darkvision"><i>Darkvision</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=PassWithoutTrace"><i>Pass Without Trace</i></a>, or <a href="./spells.html?l=Silence"><i>Silence</i></a>, without
					providing material components. Additionally, you learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=MinorIllusion"><i>Minor Illusion</i></a> cantrip if you don't already know it. The DC to investigate this
					cantrip if you learned it this way is equal to your ki save DC.
				</p>
				<h4 title="Nothing personal kid">Shadow Step</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space
					you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Cloak of Shadows</h4>
				<p>
					By 11<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Invisible">invisible</a>. You remain invisible
					until you make an attack. cast a spell. or are in an area of bright light.
				</p>
				<h4>Opportunist</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature
					other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/32519092.jpg">
				<p>
					Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the
					soul of every living creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Radiant Sun Soul</h4>
				<p>
					You can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance. You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You
					are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is your Martial Arts die. When you take the Attack action on
					your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can
					be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action
				</p>
				<h4>Searing Arc Strike</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points to cast the
					<i>Burning Hands</i> spell as a bonus action. You can spend additional ki points to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=BurningHands"><i>Burning Hands</i></a> as a higher-level spell. Each additional
					ki point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of ki points (including the original cost) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.
				</p>
				<h4>Searing Sunburst</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose
					within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant. Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take
					2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque. You can increase the spheres damage by spending ki points. Each point you
					spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.
				</p>
				<h4>Sun Shield</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the
					light as a bonus action. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your
					Wisdom modifier.

			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/60303688.jpg">
			<h2>Paladin</h2>
			<p>
				Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance
				shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.
			</p>
			<p>
				A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and
				whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last
				his light overcomes its hideous darkness.
			</p>
			<p>
				A paladin is a living embodiment of an oath—a promise or a vow made manifest in the person of a holy warrior who has the skill and the determination to see the cause through to the end. Some
				paladins devote themselves expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading justice in the world, while others resolve to attain that goal by conquering those who stand defiant and bringing them
				under the rule of law. Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a
				priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of
				power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.
			</p>
			<h4>The Cause of Righteousness</h4>
			<p>
				A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different
				paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a
				paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so
				their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the
				fight for justice. Although no paladin in the world could be described as typical, a number of them are narrow-minded do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest deviation from their own
				outlook. Paladins who take up the adventuring life, however, rarely remain so rigid in their attitudes—if only to keep from alienating their companions.
			</p>
			<h4>Beyond the Mundane Life</h4>
			<p>
				Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the
				cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive
				the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but
				even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country. Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest
				driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion. 
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Paladin</h4>
			<p>
				The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of their holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don't appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that
				choice by reading the subclass descriptions at the bottom of this page. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to
				smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are
				you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? The Other Rules page lists many deities
				worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.
			</p>
			<p>
				How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to
				train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps, drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found
				yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into
				the world with that purpose stamped on your soul. As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice.
				Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortaIs. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath
				might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.
			</p>
			<details>

						It's important to keep in mind that most paladins aren't robots. They have doubts and prejudices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any other character does. Some are compelled by an

					<h4>Personal Goal</h4>
					<p>
						The precepts of a paladin's oath provide purpose to the character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall intent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from that, some paladins
						are driven by a personal goal that either complements or transcends the dictates of their oaths. Paladins who swear different oaths might have the same personal goal, differing only in how
						they apply that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths. If your paladin character has a personal goal, it might be drawn from some life event and thus not directly tied to the oath.

						paladin's life. Your paladin character might have an enemy that dates from the days before you took up your path. Or you could be a target because when you became a paladin, you immediately

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every paladin gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Divine Sense</h4>
				<p>
					The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such
					forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or
					undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or
					object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain
					all expended uses.
				</p>
				<h4>Lay on Hands</h4>
				<p>
					Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your
					paladin level &times; 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
					Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize
					multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
				</p>
				<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to
					choose again.
				</p>
				<div> <!-- fighting styles -->
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Blessed Warrior</b></summary>
						You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this
						class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Blind Fighting</b></summary>
						You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see
						an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Defense</b></summary>
						While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary>
							<b>Dueling</b>
						</summary>
						When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Great Weapon Fighting</b></summary>
						When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have
						the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary>
							<b>Interception</b>
						</summary>
						When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency
						bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Protection</b></summary>
						When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, if you are wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
					</details>
				</div>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					By 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting
					and "Spell Lists" for the paladin spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for paladin spells. You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>
					The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
					regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so,
					choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
					For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd
					level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
					doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer
					and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>Divine Smite</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The
					extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
				</p>
				<h4>Divine Health</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.
				</p>
				<h4>Harness Divine Power</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity (see the Subclasses introduction) to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a
					prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level
					you've reached in this class: 3<sup>rd</sup> level, once; 7<sup>th</sup> level, twice; and 15<sup>th</sup> level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Martial Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This
					replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.
				</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of Protection</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma
					modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18<sup>th</sup> level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of Courage</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. At 18<sup>th</sup> level, the range of this aura increases to 30
					feet. 
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Divine Smite</h4>
				<p>
					By 11<sup>th</sup> level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature
					takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.
				</p>
				<h4>Cleansing Touch</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
					Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Sacred Oaths</h2>
			<p>
				When you reach 3<sup>th</sup> level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Oath Spells</b><br>
				Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath
				spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Channel Divinity</b><br>
				Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your
				Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
			</p>
			<h4>Breaking Your Oath</h4>
			<p>
				The oathbreaker option detailed in this section isn't normally available to you at 3<sup>rd</sup> level. Rather, it represents a paladin who has broken and abandoned their oath in such a drastic way
				that they fell into darkness. Even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the
				heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith, or from another paladin of the
				same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin
				starts fresh.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this
				class and adopt another, or to take the Oathbreaker subclass instead of their previous one.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Oath of the Ancients -->
				<summary><h4>Oath of the Ancients</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot
					with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of
					honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of the Ancients</h4>
				<p>
					The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principies of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principies
					are simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Kindle the Light:</b> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Shelter the Light:</b> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life fiourishes, stand against the forces that
					would render it barren.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preserve Your Own Light:</b>  Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Be the Light:</b> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.
				</p>

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath</h4>
				<p>
					You invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on
					a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a>. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees
					itself and the vines vanish.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn the Faithless</h4>
				<p>
					You can utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a
					Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it
					can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
					If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is
					turned.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of Warding</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 7<sup>th</sup> level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
				</p>
				<h4>Undying Sentinel</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it
					again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
				</p>
				<h4>Elder Champion</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your
					hair might become leafy or mosslike, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points</li>
					<li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>
					<li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Oath of Conquest -->
				<summary><h4>Oath of Conquest</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/6/6d/Flame_Emperor_Heroes.png">
				<p>
					The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos.
					Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might. Some of these paladins go so far
					as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins—called hell knights—as his
					most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often
					most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of Conquest</h4>
				<p>
					A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Douse the Flame of Hope:</b> It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end
					a life. Fear can end an empire.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Rule with an Iron Fist:</b> Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who
					might follow.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Strength Above All:</b> You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Conquering Presence</h4>
				<p>
					You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
					failed save, a creature becomes <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

					You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice
					after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

				<h4>Aura of Conquest</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. If a
					creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there. At 18<sup>th</sup>
					level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
				</p>
				<h4>Scornful Rebuke</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal
					to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.

				<h4>Invincible Conqueror</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1

					<li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.</li>
					<li>Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20</li>

				<summary><h4>Oath of the Crown</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath
					dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of
					barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of
					knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of the Crown</h4>
				<p>
					The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which the oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Law:</b> The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Loyalty:</b> Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Courage:</b> You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Responsibility:</b> You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

					The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called white knights or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining
					armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the
					same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their
					ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

				<h4>Tenets of Devotion</h4>

					Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

					<b>Honesty:</b> Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Courage:</b> Never fear to act, though caution is wise.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Compassion:</b> Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

				<p>
					<b>Honor:</b> Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

					(with a minimum bonus of +1).The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
					make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you
					as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
					prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of Devotion</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious. At 18<sub>th</sub> level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

					attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Curse of Hexes</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you curse one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you curse a target, choose an ability score. The chosen creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and
					ability checks using that ability score for one minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious. At the end of each of the cursed creature's turns, it can make a Charisma saving

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Curse of Torment</h4>

					force that enemy to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you can magically redirect the attack to another creature of your choice within 10 feet of you and

				<p>
					The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any
					person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay
					their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that
					undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the
					redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of Redemption</h4>
				<p>
					The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Peace:</b> Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Innocence:</b> All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to
					heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Patience:</b> Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a
					creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Wisdom:</b> Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have
					no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with
					it knowing your path is just.

					which has gone wrong. To these paladins, sometimes called avengers or dark knights, their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of Vengeance</h4>
				<p>
					The tenets of the Oath of Vengeanee vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even
					their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Fight the Greater Evil:</b> Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>No Mercy for the Wicked:</b> Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>By Any Means Necessary:</b> My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Restitution:</b> If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation. Choose one ereature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That ereature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless
					it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While
					frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity</h4>
				<p>
					As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0
					hit points or falls unconscious.
				</p>
				<h4>Relentless Avenger</h4>
				<p>
					By 7<sup>th</sup> level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the
					attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
				</p>
				<h4>Soul of Vengeance</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an
					attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attaek against that creature if it is within range.
				</p>
				<h4>Avenging Angel</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>
					<li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
						throw or become <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

				<summary><h4>Oath of the Watchers</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their
					minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats. Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often
					establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as wearing
					armor in battle.
				</p>
				<h4>Tenets of the Watchers</h4>
				<p>
					A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers swears to safeguard mortal realms from otherworldly threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Vigilance:</b> The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Loyalty:</b> Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, your comrades, and your duty.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Discipline:</b> You are the shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.

				<h4>Channel Divinity: Watcher's Will</h4>
				<p>
					You can use your Channel Divinity to invest your presence with the warding power of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a
					number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Abjure the Extraplanar</h4>
				<p>
					You can use your Channel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an action, you present your holy symbol and each aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 feet of you that
					can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
					from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
					moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can take the Dodge action.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of the Sentinel</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you emit an aura of alertness while you aren't incapacitated. When you and any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you roll initiative, you all gain a
					bonus to initiative equal to your proficiency bonus. At 18<sup>th</sup> level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
				</p>
				<h4>Vigilant Rebuke</h4>
				<p>
					By 15<sup>th</sup> level, you've learned how to chastise anyone who dares wield beguilements against you and your wards. Whenever you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on
					an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force damage to the creature that forced the saving throw.
				</p>
				<h4>Mortal Bulwark</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you manifest a spark of divine power in defense of the mortal realms. As a bonus action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>
					<li>You have advantage on attack rolls against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends.</li>
					<li>When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is
						magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Fiendish Smite</h4>
				<p>
					An Oathbreaker deals an additional 1d8 to celestials with their divine smite feature, instead of fiends and undead.
				</p>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Control Undead</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you can target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey your commands for the next
					24 hours, or until  you use this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your level is immune to this effect.
				</p>

					<h4><i>Oathbreaker Atonement</i></h4>
					<p>
						If you have fallen and become an Oathbreaker, you can later atone and become a true paladin once more.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you wish to atone you must first shed your evil alignment and demonstrate this alignment change through words and deeds. Having done so, you lose all Oathbreaker features and must choose
						a deity and a sacred oath. With your DMs permission, the god and oath could be different from the ones you had previously. However, you don't gain the class features specific to that sacred
						oath until you complete some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as determined by your DM.
					</p>
					<p>
						A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time can become an oathbreaker once more, but can't atone.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Channel Divinity: Dreadful Aspect</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you channel the darkest emotions and focus them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see
					you. On a failed save, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving
					throw to end the effect on it.
				</p>
				<h4>Aura of Hate</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 7<sup>th</sup> level, you, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature
					can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. At 18<sup>th</sup> level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
				</p>
				<h4>Supernatural Resistance</h4>
				<p>
					At 15<sup>th</sup> level, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
				</p>
				<h4>Dread Lord</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can surround yourself with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around you to dim light.
					Whenever an enemy that is frightened by you starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, you and creatures you choose in the aura are draped in deeper shadow.
					Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow. While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the
					aura to attack one creature. You make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your Charisma modifier. Once you use this
					action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

			<!--Sagittarian Oath, Pony Play paladin that doesn't really match a normal character. here because I kind of want to play an awakened warhorse with this subclass

				Fly, Freedom of Movement           13
				Circle of Power, Destructive Wave  17
					Equine Combat
				You have sharpened your focus on the equestrian arts to such a degree that you can function as a mount yourself. This can take many forms, anything from pulling a small cart, a back mounted saddle
				rig, or simply letting another take control of the reins attached to your bridle. Whatever the method, a creature of your size or smaller may mount you as an action. While you are being mounted you
				cannot make any attacks with weapons or use items, but you may still cast spells. As long as a creature is mounting you, you take your turn immediately preceding them in the initiative order. As
				well, they share your space and move with you when you move, but may not move of their own accord without first dismounting as an action. If you fall unconscious or prone, your rider is
				automatically dismounted.
				In addition, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet and your carrying capacity is doubled.
					Cavalry Tactics
				You have not only mastered the act of embodying the equestrian form, but also the art of mounted combat. While you are being mounted, you may do any of the following actions.
				• Charge Strike. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line directly toward a creature, the charged creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The DC for this
				feature is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
				• Circle Flank. If you move from one side of a creature to its opposite side with your movement, until the start of your next turn your rider makes all melee attacks with advantage against that
				creature.
				• Hind Kick. You kick out with one of your powerful legs. When you take the attack action to make an unarmed attack against a creature within 5 feet of you, on a hit you deal 1d8 + your Strength
				modifier bludgeoning damage and may push the creature 5 feet away from you.
				In addition, you have devoted yourself wholly to the protection of your rider. As a bonus action, you may take any of the following stances on your turn. Each effect given by the chosen stance lasts
				until the start of your next turn.
				• Guarded. Your rider has a bonus to their AC and Dexterity saving throws equal to your proficiency bonus.
				• Inspiring. Your rider has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and is immune to being frightened. If your rider is frightened when you take this stance, the frightened
				effect ends.
				• Empowering. Your rider may reroll any roll of 1 on their damage dice, but they must use the new roll, even if it is another 1. In addition, change the damage type of any damage your rider does to
				radiant. In addition, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage so long as that spell is affecting your rider.
					Channel Divinity
				You gain the following two Channel Divinity options:
				• Aid Rider. As a bonus action you pour divine intent into your rider’s actions. For 1 minute your rider regains the maximum amount of hit points possible from any healing and gains advantage on
				all skill checks you are proficient in.
				• Unbridled Spell. As a bonus action, you channel your own spellcasting abilities into your rider. For the next minute, your rider may cast any spell you have prepared, expending your spell slots,
				and using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC.
					War Horse’s Aura      Lv7, Lv18
				Your prowess as a beast of martial combat inspires similarly mounted creatures around you. Your rider and all mounted creatures within 10 feet of you automatically succeed saving throws to avoid
				being dismounted and gain a +2 bonus to their armor class. As well, both yourself and creatures within that range that are being ridden do not suffer penalties to movement speed other than effects
				that would reduce their speed to 0 and also gain a +2 bonus to their armor class. The armor class bonus does not stack with the Guarded stance from your Cavalry Tactics feature.
				At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
					Spry Step      Lv15
				You may take either the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action during your turn.
					Holy Steed      Lv20
				You can assume the form of a divine equine being, taking on an appearance you choose. For example you may grow a long white glowing mane of hair, or shapeshift into an ethereal pegasus with wings
				of radiant flame. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
				• You have resistance to all forms of damage from creatures other than yourself.
				• You have a flying speed of 30 feet.
				• You and your rider may move through other creatures and inanimate objects. If you end your movement in the same spot as a solid object or another creature, you are immediately shunted to the
				nearest unoccupied space.
				• At the end of your turn, you may choose to have each creature you moved through this turn either take 2d6 radiant damage or heal 2d6 hit points, the choice you make applies to all eligible
				creatures.
				Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest

			<h2>Ranger</h2>
			<p>
				Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm, Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind
				of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.
			</p>
			<p>
				After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like
				the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.
			</p>
			<p>
				Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking
				and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Far fram the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
				plains, rangers keep their unending watch. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely understood and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their
				work makes the world a safer place.
			</p>
			<p>
				A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history. Some rangers see themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization's frontier, answering to
				no sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish monsters to keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the
				world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.
			</p>
			<h4>Deadly Hunters</h4>
			<p>
				Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrasities, terrible giants, and deadly
				dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that
				are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does.
				Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
			</p>
			<h4>Independent Adventurers</h4>
			<p>
				Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend he outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press
				in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a
				band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far fram
				the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and
				compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to
				feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Ranger</h4>
			<p>
				As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you
				mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part
				of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical
				connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
			</p>
			<p>
				What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters
				cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with
				a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

					<h4>View of the World</h4>
					<p>
						A ranger's view of the world begins (and sometimes ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk and the places they occupy. Some rangers have an attitude toward civilization
						that's deeply rooted in disdain, while others pity the people they have sworn to protect—though on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell the difference between one ranger and another.
						Indeed, to those who have seen them operate and been the beneficiaries of their prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers do what they do. That said, no two rangers are likely to express
						their opinions on any matter in the same way. If you haven't yet thought about the details of your character's worldview, consider putting a finer point on things by summarizing that
						viewpoint in a short statement (such as the entries on the following table). How might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?

					<p>
						All rangers, regardless of how they came to take up the profession, have a strong connection to the natural world and its various terrains. For some rangers, the wilderness is where they
						grew up, either as a result of being born there or moving there at a young age. For other rangers, civilization was originally home, but the wilderness became a second homeland. Think of
						your character's backstory and decide what terrain feels most like home, whether or not you were born there. What does that terrain say about your personality? Does it influence which spells
						you choose to learn? Have your experiences there shaped who your favored enemies are?

					<h4>Sworn Enemy</h4>
					<p>
						Every ranger begins with a favored enemy (or two). The determination of a favored enemy might be tied to a specific event in the character's early life, or it might be entirely a matter of
						choice. What spurred your character to select a particular enemy? Was the choice made because of tradition or curiosity, or do you have a grudge to settle?

			<h4>Quick Build</h4>
			<p>
				You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength
				higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every ranger gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Favored Enemy</h4>
				<p>
					You have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons,
					elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one
					language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6<sup>th</sup> and
					14<sup>th</sup> level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
				</p>
				<h4>Explorer: Natural</h4>
				<p>
					You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest,
					grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that
					you're proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Difticult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
					<li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</li>
					<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
					<li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
					<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
					<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You choose additional favored terrain types at 6<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Explorer: Deft</h4>
				<p>
					You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
					ability check you make that uses the chosen skill. You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.<br>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.<br>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this
					action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if
					any, is decreased by 1.
				</p>
				<h4>Fighting Style</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later
					get to choose again.
				</p>
				<div> <!-- fighting styles -->
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Archery</b></summary>
						You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Blind Fighting</b></summary>
						You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see
						an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Defense</b></summary>
						While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Druidic Warrior</b></summary>
						You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this
						class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Dueling</b></summary>
						When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Thrown Weapon Fighting</b></summary>
						You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus
						to the damage roll.
					</details>
					<details class="invocation">
						<summary><b>Two-Weapon Fighting</b></summary>
						When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
					</details>
				</div>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					By 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting
					and "Spell Lists" for the ranger spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for ranger spells. The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of these
					spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your
					ranger spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher</b><br>
					You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells
					must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a
					level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
				</p>
				<h4>Primal Awareness</h4>
				<p>
					You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number
					of ranger spells you know.
				</p>

				</table>
				<p>
					<br>You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Martial Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This
					replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.
				</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Land's Stride</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 8<sup>th</sup> level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without
					taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede
					movement, such those created by the <a href="./spells.html?l=Entangle"><i>Entangle</i></a> spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Hide in Plain Sight</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with
					which to create your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and
					wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
					camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
				</p>
				<h4>Vanish</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
				</p>
				<h4>Feral Senses</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose
					disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't
					blinded or deafened.
				</p>
				<h4>Foe Slayer</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you
					make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Ranger Archetypes</h2>
			<p><i>I'm a monster. Are you going to try to kill me? Didn't think so. Go kill some goblins or something. On second thought. goblins aren't monsters—they're people. So maybe you should call
				yourself a people killer.</i><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— Xanathar, Waterdeep crime boss<br><br></p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Beast Master -->
				<summary><h4>Beast Master</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten
					civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
				</p>
				<h4>Ranger's Companion</h4>
				<p>
					You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a chaIlenge rating of 1/4 or
					lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal
					maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
				</p>
				<p>
					The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast
					where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you
					can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal
					pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magicaIly bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.
				</p>
				<h4>Exceptional Training</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 7<sup>th</sup> level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help
					action on its turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Bestial Fury</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, your beast companion can make two attacks when you command it to use the Attack action.
				</p>
				<h4>Share Spells</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 15<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

					Your connection to the natural world takes the form of a draconic spirit, which can manifest in physical form as a drake. As your powers grow, your drake grows as well, blossoming from a small
					four-legged companion to a majestic winged creature large and strong enough for you to ride. Along the way, you gain an increasing share of the awe-inspiring power of dragons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the source of the draconic spirit you have bonded with. The Drakewarden Origin table offers examples.
				</p>
				<h4>Draconic Gifts</h4>
				<p>
					You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic. If you already know Draconic, you instead learn one other language of your choice. You also learn the
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Thaumaturgy"><i>Thaumaturgy</i></a> cantrip, which is a ranger spell for you.
				</p>
				<h4>Drake Companion</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you. The drake is friendly to you and your companions,
					and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake,
					choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its
					Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
				</p>
				<p>
					In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the
					Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake
					can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
				</p>
				<p>
					The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the
					drake vanishes. Once you summon the drake, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.

				</details>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, The bond you share with your drake intensifies, protecting you and stoking the drakes fury. Your drake changes in the following ways:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Its size becomes Medium</li>
					<li>It grows wings on its backm, giving it a flying speed equal to its walking speed.</li>
					<li>Its Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence trait.</li>

					Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount if your size is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it can't use its flying speed. In addition, while your drake is
					summoned, you gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drake's Draconic Essence trait.
				</p>
				<h4>Drake's Breath</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, As an action, you can exhale a 30-foot cone of damaging breath or cause your drake to exhale it. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your
					choice doesn’t have to match your drake's Draconic Essence). Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half
					as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases to 10d6 when you reach 15<sup>th</sup> level in this class. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long
					rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Perfected Bond</h4>
				<p>
					At 15<sup>th</sup> level, your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. Your drake changes in the following ways:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Its size becomes Large. It is can now use its flying speed even when you are riding it.</li>
					<li>Its Bite attack deals another extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence trait.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In addition, when either you or the drake takes damage while you're within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage.
					You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

					your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the

				<h4>Dreadful Strikes</h4>
				<p>
					You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the

					<br> You also possess a preternatural blessing from a fey ally or a place of fey power. The Feywild Gift Suggestions table offers some ideas for what form your blessing could take.
				</p>
				<h4>Otherworldly Glamour</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 7<sup>th</sup> level, Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. Whenever you make a Charisma check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of
					+1). In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Performance, or Persuasion.
				</p>
				<h4>Beguiling Twist</h4>
				<p>
					Also beginning at 7<sup>th</sup> level, The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, whenever you or a
					creature you can see within 120 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can use your reaction to force a different creature you can see within 120 feet of
					you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the save fails, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute. The
					target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.
				</p>
				<h4>Fey Reinforcements</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, the royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings. You know <a href="./spells.html?l=SummonFey"><i>Summon Fey</i></a>. It
					doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so
					when you finish a long rest. Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that
					casting. 
				</p>
				<h4>Misty Wanderer</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye. You can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=MistyStep"><i>Misty Step</i></a> without expending
					a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, whenever you cast
					<a href="./spells.html?l=MistyStep"><i>Misty Step</i></a>, you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your
					choice within 5 feet of your destination space.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Gloom Stalker -->
				<summary><h4>Gloom Stalker</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation,
					but a Gloom Stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any
					place where evil lurks in the shadows.
				</p>
				<h4>Gloom Stalker Magic</h4>

				<h4>Dread Ambusher</h4>
				<P>
					You master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier. At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed
					increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits,
					the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapons damage type.
				</P>
				<h4>Umbral Sight</h4>
				<p>
					You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet. You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision.
					While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.
				</p>
				<h4>Iron Mind</h4>
				<p>
					By 7<sup>th</sup> level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you
					instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
				</p>
				<h4>Stalker's Flurry</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make
					another weapon attack as part of the same action.
				</p>
				<h4>Shadowy Dodge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage
					on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.

					You gain the ability to magically sense the presence of a planar portal. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal within 1 mile of you. Once you use this
					feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Planar Warrior</h4>

					You learn to draw on the energy of the multiverse to augment your attacks. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The next time you hit that creature on this
					turn with a weapon attack, all damage dealt by the attack becomes force damage, and the creature takes an extra 1d8 force damage from the attack. When you reach 11<sup>th</sup> level in this
					class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

				<h4>Ethereal Step</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Etherealness"><i>Etherealness</i></a> spell with this feature,

					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to pass between the planes in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an
					unoccupied space you can see. If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Spectral defense</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from
					an attack, you can use your reaction to give yourself resistance to all of that attack’s damage on this turn

				<h4>Bonded Beginnings</h4>
				<p>
					You are inseparable from the Horrorling to which you have bonded. The Horrorling is a sentient entity that can speak with you telepathically, and vice versa. If you become unbonded with your
					Horrorling, or it is forcibly removed from you, you take 4d6 psychic damage and become <a href="./combat.html?f=Stunned">stunned</a>. You regain the lost hit points if the Horrorling is
					returned to you.
				</p>
				<h4>Symbiotic Warfare</h4>
				<p>
					You and your Horrorling have learned to fight together. Though it is not large yet, you can make use of its physical prowess. You gain access to the following features:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Claws and Pincers:</i></b> As a melee weapon attack, you may use your Horrorlings limbs to strike. The attack bonus for this is equal to your spell attack bonus. On a hit, this attack
						deals 1d8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier slashing damage. If you make at least one attack with this feature, you may make another as a bonus action.</li>
					<li><b><i>Spider Walk:</i></b>  You may climb surfaces without needing to make an ability check.</li>
					<li><b><i>Eyes of the Horrorling:</i></b> You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Growing Close</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you have begun to give yourself wholly over to the Horrorling. You may no longer wield weapons, relying entirely on the claws and pincers of your Horrorling to attack.
					As well, your claws and pincers count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical attacks and damage. However, if your Horrorling is removed from you, you
					take 6d6 psychic damage and become incapacitated until is it returned to you.<br>
					At the same time, your Horrorling has been growing stronger. You may add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to attack rolls with your Claws and Pincers, and add your Wisdom modifier to the
					damage. Your speed also increases by 5ft.
				</p>
				<h4>Feast</h4>
				<p>
					Also, beginning at 7<sup>th</sup> level, your Horrorling's feeding on prey has begun to tangibly benefit both of you. When you kill a creature of challenge rating 2 or higher, as a reaction you
					may feast on its corpse, consuming it in the process. When you do so, you regain hit points equal to your Ranger level plus your Wisdom modifier. You may use this ability a number of times equal
					to your proficiency bonus and regain all spent uses when you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Inseparable Pair</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you and your Horrorling have become wholly intertwined. If your Horrorling is removed from you, you die. However, as the Horrorling's tendrils have become hooked into
					your brain, you are fortified by its own force of will. You gain proficiency in both Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.
				</p>
				<h4>Ravenous Grasp</h4>
				<p>
					Also at 11<sup>th</sup> level, you become adept at restraining creatures in order to eat them alive. As a reaction when you hit a creature of your size or smaller with your Claws and Pincers,
					you may have the target make a Strength saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure, the target is pulled into your writhing biomass and becomes
					<a href="./combat.html?f=Grappled">grappled</a>. While grappled this way, the creature is <a href="./combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a>. You may only have 1 creature grappled in this way.
					At the start of your turn, you may deal 1d4 necrotic damage to the grappled creature. If you do, you regain 1d4 hit points.
				</p>
				<h4>Purpose Fulfilled</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you have fused with your Horrorling at the deepest levels. You may no longer be separated from your Horrorling. Your speed is increased by 5ft, and you gain
					the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings without using your hands. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
				</p>
				<h4>Flurry of Fangs and Claws</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you may make a Claws and Pincers attack against all creatures within 15 feet of you. You may use this ability twice, and regain all spent uses when you complete a short or long
					rest.
				</p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Hunter -->
				<summary><h4>Hunter</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for
					fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

				<h4>Hunter's Prey</h4>

					<b>Giant Killer:</b><br>

					the creature.

				<h4>Defensive Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you gain one of the foIlowing features of your choice.

				<p>
					<b>Volley:</b><br>
					You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Stand Against the Tide:</b><br>

				<h4>Hunter's Sense</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the
					creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances,
					or vulnerabilities. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Slayer's Prey</h4>
				<p>
					You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first
					time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you
					designate a different creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Supernatural Defense</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you gain extra resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever
					you make an ability check to escape that targets grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.
				</p>
				<h4>Magic-User's Nemesis</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else's magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to
					magically foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or its spell or teleport fails and is wasted. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
					until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Slayer's Counter</h4>
				<p>
					At 15<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your
					reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the
					attack's normal effects

					Feeling a deep connection to the environment around them, some rangers reach out through their magical connection to the world and bond with a swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a
					potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the
					discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.

				<p>
					A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. Until you die, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you
					within your space. You determine its appearance, or you generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance Suggestions table. Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to
					assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The attack's target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm .</li>
					<li>The attack's target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.</li>

					<h4><i>It's Your Swarm</i></h4>
					<p>
						A Swarmkeeper's swarm and spells are reflections of the character's bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger's magic in play. For example, when
						your ranger casts <a href="./spells.html?l=GaseousForm"><i>Gaseous Form</i></a>, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the
						<a href="./spells.html?l=ArcaneEye"><i>Arcane Eye</i></a> spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you.
					</p>
					<p title="for now idk what to call the customization section">
						Such descriptions don't change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character's narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on
						customizing spells, see "Adding Some Personal Flair to Your Spells" on the Spells page. Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single
						appearance. Perhaps the spirits' look changes with the ranger's mood or with the seasons. You decide!

			<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/6/68/Gaius_%28FE13_Artwork%29.png">
			<h2>Rogue</h2>
			<p><i>I don't have enough fingers and toes to count the times I saw our little rogue cheat death, but I remember them all. Let's see... there was the enraged roper, the flaming lava stream, the
				catapulted gelatinous cubes, the Ten Tilting Corridors of Death, the exploding toad trap , the Hall of the Spinning Scimitars...</i><br><br></p>
				<p class="quotsauc">— Magnificus, Wizard extraordinaire</i></p>
			<p>
				Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye.
				Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.
			</p>
			<p>
				A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver
				comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are
				free to make their escape.
			</p>
			<p>
				When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out
				of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate. Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the
				solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.
			</p>
			<h4>Skill and Precision</h4>
			<p>
				Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many
				rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. When it comes to
				combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a
				barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
			</p>
			<h4>A Shady Living</h4>
			<p>
				Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels
				are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an
				honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers. As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the
				law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills
				with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Rouge</h4>
			<p>
				As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master?
				Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?
			</p>
			<p>
				What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave
				you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you
				had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular
				talents.

					<h4>Guilty Pleasure</h4>
					<p>
						Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away
						from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking—an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky. A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a
						physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot
						is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice. What's the one form of temptation that
						your rogue character can't resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?

						nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to
						be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch. If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with
						a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become
						known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure. Does your rogue character have an adversary who also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relationship

				You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First. Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at investigation or plan

			</p>
			<h4>Equipment</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">Y</span>ou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>(a)</b> a rapier or <b>(b)</b> a shortsword</li>
				<li><b>(a)</b> a shortbow and a quiver of 20 arrows or <b>(b)</b> a shortsword</li>

				<li>Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves' tools</li>
				<li>4d4 &times; 10 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every rouge gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Expertise</h4>
				<p>
					Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
					either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.
				</p>
				<h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
				<p>
					You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
					The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't
					have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.
				</p>
				<h4>Thieves' Cant</h4>
				<p>
					During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that
					knows thieves' cant understands such messages. lt takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs
					and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy
					marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
				</p>
				<h4>Cunning Action</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to
					take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
				</p>
				<h4>Steady Aim</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, as a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this
					turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Uncanny Dodge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
				</p>
				<h4>Evasion</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a <a href="../dg/monstersfrigg.html?s=Blue Dragon"><b>blue dragon's</b></a>
					lightning breath or a <a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
					you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
				</p>
				<h4>Reliable Talent</h4>
				<p>
					By 11<sup>th</sup> level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20
					roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
				</p>
				<h4>Blindsense</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
				</p>
				<h4>Slippery Mind</h4>
				<p>
					By 15<sup>th</sup> level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
				</p>
				<h4>Elusive</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
				</p>
				<h4>Stroke of Luck</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an
					ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Rougish Archetypes</h2>
			<p>
				Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues
				steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a
				description of your preferred techniques.

				<p>
					Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters,
					mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.
				</p>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to cast spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the
					wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for wizard spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You learn three cantrips: <a href="./spells.html?l=MageHand"><i>Mage Hand</i></a> and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your
					choice at 10<sup>th</sup> level.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level
					or higher. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=CharmPerson"><i>Charm Person</i></a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast it
					using either slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells known of 1st level and higher</b><br>
					You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment or illusion spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcane
					Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st-level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level
					for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7<sup>th</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spells you learn at 8<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 20<sup>th</sup> level (marked with an asterisk on the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table) can come from any school of magic.
					Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for
					which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, or 20<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Mage Hand Legerdemain</h4>
				<p>
					When you cast <a href="./spells.html?l=MageHand"><i>Mage Hand</i></a>, you can make the spectral hand <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Invisible">invisible</a>, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>
					<li>You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.</li>
					<li>You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check. In addition,
					you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.
				</p>
				<h4>Magical Ambush</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Versatile Trickster</h4>
				<p>
					At 13<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your <a href="./spells.html?l=MageHand"><i>Mage Hand</i></a>. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature
					within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Spell Thief</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.
				</p>
				<p>
					Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting
					ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a
					level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours
					have passed. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Assassin -->
				<summary><h4>Assassin</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:20%;" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/6/66/ACI-Ezio.png">
				<p>
					You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate
					the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.
				</p>
				<h4>Bonus Proficiencies</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.
				</p>
				<h4>Assassinate</h4>
				<p>
					You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you
					score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
				</p>
				<h4>Infiltration Expertise</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an
					identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to
					establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a
					disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.
				</p>
				<h4 title="kinda sus">Impostor</h4>
				<p>
					At 13<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of
					the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss,
					you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.
				</p>
				<h4>Death Strike</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity
					modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Escape Artist -->
				<summary><h4>Escape Artis</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:20%;" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/6/66/ACI-Ezio.png">
				<p>
					Escape artists devote themselves to studying the survival of dangerous situations. They often specialize in lockpicking, unfastening even the most expert of knots, and enduring the unendurable.
					Killing an escape artist is an accomplishment, and keeping one locked up is a true feat.
				</p>
				<h4>Always a Way Out</h4>
				<p>
					When you are targeted by an effect that would cause you to become grappled, restrained, or reduces your movement speed, you may choose to let the effect automatically succeed. If you do so, you
					may automatically succeed on the next saving throw or ability check that allows you to escape that effect. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, to a
					minimum of one. You regain expended uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Nothing up My Sleeve</h4>
				<p>
					You are adept at sequestering the items you need within folds of clothing, the corners of your mouth, or other more imaginative places. While clothed you may have up to 8 tiny items hidden
					about your body. While unclothed you may have up to 3 tiny items hidden. Tiny items include things like Thieves' Tools, a potion bottle, key, or anything else at the DM's discretion. You have
					access to these items regardless of whether you are restrained, so long as you are conscious. Any creature that searches you for hidden items does so with disadvantage.
				</p>
				<h4>Tools at Hand</h4>
				<p>
					You may use your Proficiency bonus when using an object that can feasibly fit in a lock in an attempt to pick it.
				</p>
				<h4>Always Wary</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, you cannot be surprised while you are conscious, and have advantage on Initiative rolls. In addition, any Wisdom (Perception) and Investigation (Intelligence)
					checks you make to find hidden dangers such as traps or ambushers are made with advantage.
				</p>
				<h4>Learned Luck</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, when you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll, you may instead make that roll without disadvantage. You may
					use this feature thrice per short rest. Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level you may use this feature four times per short rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Endure to survive</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you have honed your physicality such that you can survive even the harshest of situations without losing effectiveness. You can hold your breath for up to two hours,
					do not suffer any penalties to attack rolls or skill checks for being blinded or deafened, only need to eat and drink once every 7 days, only accrue exhaustion for not sleeping after the 7th
					missed night's sleep, and do not suffer any penalties for being in an extremely hot or cold environment.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Inquisitive -->
				<summary><h4>Inquisitive</h4></summary>
				<p>
					As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds
					of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your keen deductions make you well
					equipped to expose and end hidden evils.
				</p>
				<h4>Ear for Deceit</h4>
				<p>
					You develop a talent for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.
				</p>
				<h4>Eye for Detail</h4>
				<p>
					You can use a bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a hidden creature or object or to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to uncover or decipher clues.
				</p>
				<h4>Insightful Fighting</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't
					incapacitated, contested by the target’s Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, but
					not if you have disadvantage on it. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.
				</p>
				<h4>Steady Eye</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Unerring Eye</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 13<sup>th</sup> level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic
					designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or
					into its true nature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Eye for Weakness</h4>
				<p>
					At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak
					Attack damage against that creature increases by 3d6.
				</p>

				<summary><h4>Mastermind</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/4/41/Jakobfullbody.png">
				<p>
					Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as
					knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.
				</p>
				<h4>Master of Intrigue</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with the disguise kit, the forgery kit, and one gaming set of your choice. You also learn two languages of your choice. Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech
					patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.
				</p>
				<h4>Master of Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					You can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather
					than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.
				</p>
				<h4>Insightful Manipulator</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared
					to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intelligence score</li>
					<li>Wisdom score</li>
					<li>Charisma score</li>
					<li>Class levels (if any)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature’s history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.
				</p>
				<h4>Misdirection</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 13<sup>th</sup> level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is
					granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.
				</p>
				<h4>Soul of Deceit</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check
					contested by the mind reader’s Wisdom (Insight) check. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so
					choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Phantom -->
				<summary><h4>Phantom</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death
					itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers
					and spies.<br>
					How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?
				</p>
				<h4>Whispers of the Dead</h4>
				<p>
					Echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain it, as a ghostly presence shares its
					knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.
				</p>
				<h4>Wails from the Grave</h4>
				<p>
					As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can
					target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage
					equal to the roll's total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when
					you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Tokens of the Departed</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, when a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form:<br>
					As a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form
					or has you roll on the Trinkets table on the Items page to generate it. You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your
					maximum. You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object</li>
					<li>When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of
						that feature</li>
					<li>As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to
						you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life,
						as determined by the DM.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Ghost Walk</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, You can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you assume a spectral form. While in this form, you have a flying
					speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attack rolls have disadvantage against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage
					if you end your turn inside a creature or an object. You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, you must finish a long rest or destroy
					one of your soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to activate Ghost Walk.
				</p>
				<h4>Death's Friend</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, Your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When you use your Wails from the Grave feature, you can deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.</li>
					<li>At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Scout -->
				<summary><h4>Scout</h4></summary>
				<p>
					You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the
					wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter—these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they
					range the world.
				</p>
				<h4>Skirmisher</h4>
				<p>
					You are difficult to pin down during a fight. You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
				</p>
				<h4>Survivalist</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in the Nature and Survival skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.
				</p>
				<h4>Superior Mobility</h4>
				<p>
					At 9<sup>th</sup> level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.
				</p>
				<h4>Ambush Master</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, you excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight. You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first
					round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Sudden Strike</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit
					from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Soulknife -->
				<summary><h4>Soulknife</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind,
					cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of
					thieves' guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a
					Soulknife as a spy.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out
					a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.
				</p>
				<h4>Psionic Power</h4>
				<p>
					You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your
					proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if
					it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one
					expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at
					5<sup>th</sup> level (d8), 11<sup>th</sup> level (d10), and 17<sup>th</sup> level (d12). The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Psi-Bolstered Knack:</b><br>
					When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and
					add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Psychic Whispers:</b><br>
					You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others—perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal
					to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak
					telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak
					any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other. The first
					time you use this power after each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.
				</p>
				<h4>Psychic Blades</h4>
				<p>
					You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with
					that blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a normal range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, it deals psychic damage equal to
					1d6 plus the ability modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage. After you
					attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die
					of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.
				</p>
				<h4>Soul Blades</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 9<sup>th</sup> level, Your Psychic Blades are an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic Energy dice:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Homing Strikes:</b><br>
					If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, you
					expend the Psionic Energy die.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Psychic Teleportation:</b><br>
					As a bonus action, you manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend one Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal
					to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.
				</p>
				<h4>Psychic Veil</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, you can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As an action, you can magically become <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Invisible">invisible</a>, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for
					1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw. Once
					you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to use this feature again.
				</p>
				<h4>Rend Mind</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force
					that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 minute. The stunned target can repeat
					the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three
					Psionic Energy dice to use it again.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Swashbuckler -->
				<summary><h4>Swashbuckler</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" style="width:21%" src="../stylefiles/classimg/swashbuckler.png">
				<p>
					You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost
					like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype. A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.
				</p>
				<h4>Fancy Footwork</h4>
				<p>
					You learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for
					the rest of your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Rakish Audacity</h4>
				<p>
					Your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you
					don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage
					on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.
				</p>
				<h4>Panache</h4>
				<p>
					At 9<sup>th</sup> level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature
					must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language. If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than
					you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you
					and the target are more than 60 feet apart.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if
					you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
				</p>
				<h4>Elegant Maneuver</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 13<sup>th</sup> level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Master Duelist</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 17<sup>th</sup> level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so,
					you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Thief -->
				<summary><h4>Thief</h4></summary>
				<p>
					You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional
					treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages,
					and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.
				</p>
				<h4>Fast Hands</h4>
				<p>
					You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
				</p>
				<h4>Second-Story Work</h4>
				<p>
					You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Supreme Sneak</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Use Magic Device</h4>
				<p>
					By 13<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and
					level requirements on the use of magic items.
				</p>
				<h4>Thief's Reflexes</h4>
				<p>
					By 17<sup>th</sup> level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your
					normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

			<h2>Sorcerer</h2>
			<p><i>"Practice and study are for amateurs. True power is a birthright."</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Hennet, Scion of Tiamat</p>
			<p>
				Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to
				the air.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from
				him in a mighty blast of lightning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a
				grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence. or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language,
				any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
			</p>
			<h4>Raw Magic</h4>
			<p>
				Magic is a part of every sorcerer. suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the
				magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways. The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic
				bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some
				sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water
				from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a
				glimpse into the inner workings of reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. They have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards
				rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the
				role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them. By learning to
				harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.
			</p>
			<h4>Unexplained Powers</h4>
			<p>
				Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the
				power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on. Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic
				motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of
				it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
				knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Sorcerer</h4>
			<p>
				The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence
				of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with
				inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well? How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing
				or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this
				power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power, Perhaps your power links you to a
				powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose
				you to carry this power.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary>

						Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other
						sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities. Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging.

					<h4>Sign of Sorcery</h4>
					<p>
						As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But
						even when one's magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from. When your sorcerer character
						casts a spell, does the effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is this sign tied to your origin or some other aspect of who you are, or is it a seemingly random phenomenon?

				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See
					"Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the sorcerer spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for sorcerer spells. You can use an arcane focus
					as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br><br>
				</p>

					table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b><br>
					You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these
					spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you
					gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
					spell slots.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells. you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
					expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=BurningHands"><i>Burning Hands</i></a> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level
					spell slot available, you can cast it using either slot.
				</p>
				<h4>Font of Magic</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sorcery Points</b><br>
					You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the
					table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.<br><br>

					Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try to conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point
					to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.
				</p>
				<h4>Sorcerous Restoration</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.
				</p>

			<h2>Subclasses: Sorcerous Origins</h2>
			<p>
				Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Some inherit this ability from a magical ancestor such as a dragon or an angel, others gain it by accident from exposure to
				wild magical power, and others manifest this power by chance or the hand of fate, perhaps portended by events at their conception or birth.

					An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the
					magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange
					manifestations of your might? As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining with psionic
					awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origin Suggestions table for better ideas for a possible origin of your power than the Arcane Origin Suggestions table from earlier.

				<h4>Telepathic Speech</h4>
				<p>
					You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You and the chosen creature can speak
					telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak
					mentally in a language the other knows. The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if you are incapacitated or die or if you use this
					ability to form a connection with a different creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Psionic Sorcery</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast any spell of 1 st level or higher from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of
					sorcery points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no material components unless they are
					consumed by the spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Psychic Defenses</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
				</p>
				<h4>Revelation in Flesh</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10
					minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.</li>
					<li>You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or shines with an otherworldly light.</li>
					<li>You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed,
						or you grow writhing cilia that extend through your clothing.</li>
					<li>Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of
						movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Warping Implosion</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can unleash your aberrant power as a space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you.
					Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight
					toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled. Once you use
					this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

				<p><i>NOTE: This is an untested homebrew class and I can not guarantee its balance at all. everything here is subject to change if I ever find a problem with it.</i></p>
				<p>
					Your magic comes from the dark reaches of the abyss. Perhaps because of a foul union between mortal and demon, perhaps because you were subjected to a dark ritual, or perhaps you were just
					exposed to the abyss for too long. Regardless, your magic is fueled by havoc and blood. You are the most at home on the battlefield, tearing your enemies apart and drawing power from their
					agony. Because of the nature of your magic, you are unlikely to be well adjusted and probably have trouble fitting into your society. 
				</p>
				<h4>Invigorating Spell</h4>
				<p title="For example, if you hit two creatures that failed their saving throw with a Shatter spell, and roll 7 across your 3d8, you gain 14 temporary hit points, not 7.">
					You have this additional metamagic option. When you deal damage with a spell, you can expend 1 sorcery point per the spell's level. If you do, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to
					the damage dealt to creatures by the spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Need to Explode</h4>
				<p>
					Your temporary hit points aren't meant to sustain you. For every point of damage taken to your temporary hit points, you instead take 2 damage to those hit points.
				</p>
				<h4>The Strength of Mayhem</h4>
				<p>
					You can use the rush you get from hurting others to fuel your magic. When you cast a spell, you can sacrifice a number of hit points (temporary or otherwise) to cast it at a higher level. The
					hit points you need to sacrifice depends on the level of the spell you are casting, equaling 10 &times; the spell's current level. You can upgrade a spell this way any number of times, paying
					the cost for the spell's upgraded level each time. (For example, casting a 2nd-level spell at 4th level costs 50 hit points)
				</p>
				<h4>Twisting Minds</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=HideousLaughter"><i>Hideous Laughter</i></a> spell, and it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. Once when
					you cast it, you can reduce its duration to 30 seconds. If you do, you don't need to concentrate on the spell to maintain it. You regain the ability to do so once you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Branded by Fire</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, You gain resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage. You also gain immunity to poison damage, and to the poisoned condition.
				</p>
				<h4>Eyes of Ember</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you gain truesight out to 120ft. You also have advantage on Strength saving throws.

				<br>In addition, consult the Manifestation of Order Suggestions table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your sorcerer spells. You
					can also make up your own manifestation, if none of the alternatives suit your fancy.
				</p>
				<h4>Restore Balance</h4>
				<p>
					Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage,
					you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage and disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
					expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Bastion of Law</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As an action, you can expend 1 to 5 sorcery points to
					create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward lasts until you finish a long rest or until you use this feature again. The ward is
					represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the
					damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.
				</p>
				<h4>Trance of Order</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to align your consciousness to the endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus action, you can enter this state for 1 minute. For the duration,
					attack rolls against you can't benefit from advantage, and whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. Once
					you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Clockwork Cavalcade</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look
					like modrons or other constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they create the following effects within the cube before vanishing:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The spirits restore up to 100 hit points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the cube.</li>
					<li>Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are repaired instantly.</li>
					<li>Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in the cube.</li>

					prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic. A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who
					commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine. In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command
					religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

				<h4>Divine Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher,
					you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.
					In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer
					spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a Spell from the cleric spell list.
				</p>
				<h4>Favored by the Gods</h4>
				<p>
					Divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you
					can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Empowered Healing</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points
					a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Otherworldly Wings</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last
					until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action. The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for
					good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.
				</p>
				<h4>Unearthly Recovery</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points
					equal to half your hit point maximum. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

					Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of
					ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given
					sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.
				</p>
				<h4>Dragon Ancestor</h4>
				<p>
					You choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by your Elemental Affinity feature starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level. You can speak, read, and
					write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.
				</p>
				<h4>Draconic Resilience</h4>
				<p>
					As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this
					class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Elemental Affinity</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the
					same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.
				</p>
				<h4>Dragon Wings</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action
					on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not
					made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.
				</p>
				<h4>Draconic Presence</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery
					points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
					spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> (if you chose awe) or <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A
					creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

				<summary><h4>Sanguine Hex</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Whether by a curse that flows through them, or an innate affinity for sanguine arts, sorcerers of the Sanguine Hex utilize blood to empower their spellwork. Unfortunately, they need access to
					the blood of their victim and as such tend to get closer to their targets than most sorcerers. Yet, once they have done so they find their craft more potent than others.
				</p>
				<h4>Start the Flow</h4>
				<p>
					You may use a dagger as your spellcasting focus. In addition, when you hit a creature with a melee attack using a weapon that deals either piercing or slashing damage, you may have the target
					make a Constitution saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature gains 1 point of <a href="./combat.html?f=Bleeding">bleeding</a>. At the end of your turn, if you have not
					cast a spell this turn and a creature gained a bleeding point as a result of your attack, you may cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 Action or 1 Bonus Action, regardless of if you had
					already used either your action or bonus action.
				</p>
				<h4>Induce Sepsis</h4>
				<p>
					When you cast a spell that deals damage to a bleeding creature, you may change the damage type to necrotic. If you do, as a reaction to this, you may have each bleeding creature affected make a
					Constitution saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure that creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each point of bleeding it has.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Metamagic</h4>
				<p>
					You have these two additional metamagic options:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Wetwork:</i></b> When a creature succeeds on a Constitution saving throw for either your Start the Flow, Induce Sepsis, Essence Drain, or Hemohex features, you may spend 1 sorcery
						point and have that creature reroll the saving throw. They must use the new result for that roll.</li>
					<li><b><i>Target Vitals:</i></b> When you deal piercing or slashing damage to a creature with a spell, you can spend any number of sorcery points, up to to the number of creatures dealt damage.
						When you do so, That many of those creatures gain 1 point of <a href="./combat.html?f=Bleeding">bleeding</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Essence Drain</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, as a reaction at the end of a turn in which a creature within 60 feet of you that is bleeding has taken damage, you may have that creature make a Constitution
					saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure you gain 1d6 temporary hit points for each point of bleeding on that creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Hemohex</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when a bleeding creature fails a saving throw against a spell you cast of 5th-level or lower, you may spend 1 sorcery point to infuse their vital essence
					with the spell's effects. The target must make a Constitution saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure, at the start of their next turn, they suffer the effects of the spell again (and
					must repeat any needed saving throws).
				</p>
				<h4>Manipulate Lifeblood</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, when a bleeding creature attacks you, they must make a Charisma saving throw vs your spell save DC. On a failure they may not target you with that attack,
					but are free to target another creature with an attack instead.

				<p>
					You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy
					and transformed by it. The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the
					dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can make up a quirk, or pick from or roll on the Quirk Suggestions table to create a quirk for your character.
				</p>
				<h4>Eyes of the Dark</h4>
				<p>
					You have darkvision with a range of 120 feet. When you reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level in this class, you learn the darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.
					In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Strength of the Grave</h4>
				<p>
					Your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken).
					On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can't use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit. After the saving throw succeeds, you can't
					use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Hound of Ill Omen</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of
					ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf's statistics, with the following changes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</li>
					<li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
					<li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
					<li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and
					it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has
					disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.
				</p>
				<h4>Shadow Walk</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 120 feet to an
					unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
				</p>
				<h4>Umbral Form</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except
					force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
					You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Storm -->
				<summary><h4>Storm Sorcery</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by a deluge, but perhaps you were born during a howling
					gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your
					being. Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in
					repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.
				</p>
				<h4>Wind Speaker</h4>
				<p>
					The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its
					dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.
				</p>
				<h4>Tempestuous Magic</h4>
				<p>
					You can use a bonus action on your turn to cause whirling gusts of elemental air to briefly surround you, immediately before or after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you
					to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks
				</p>
				<h4>Heart of the Storm</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage,
					stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates)
					equal to half your sorcerer level.
				</p>
				<h4>Storm Guide</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you. If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot—radius sphere
					centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action. If it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction that the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered
					on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.
				</p>
				<h4>Storm's Fury</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker
					must also make a Strength saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.
				</p>
				<h4>Wind Soul</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage. You also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 feet for 1 hour
					and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying
					speed in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Wild Magic -->
				<summary><h4>Wild Magic</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to
					Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent
					cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
				</p>
				<h4>Wild Magic Surge</h4>
				<p>
					Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you use metamagic to modify a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge
					table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this
					case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
				</p>
				<h4>Tides of Chaos</h4>
				<p>
					You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this
					feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, then regain the use of
					this feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Bend Luck</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can
					use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before
					any effects of the roll occur.
				</p>
				<h4>Controlled Chaos</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.
				</p>
				<h4>Spell Bombardment</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those
					dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

			<h2>Warlock</h2>
			<p>
				With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
				spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own
				power. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock
				plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Some warlocks, particularly those of fey or fiendish bloodlines, are born with a propensity for their power, drawing the attention of potential patrons even from
				childhood. Others seek out a pact, sometimes because they can't find the power they desire elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				It takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of
				bravery. Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's entering into a pact
				with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron,
				or vice versa.
			</p>
			<h4>Sworn and Beholden</h4>
			<p>
				A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for
				warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity-beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is
				similar to that between a master and an apprentice, The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf. Some warlocks forge multiple pacts,
				although they must eventually come to favor one over the others, as their patrons are jealous and possessive beings.
			</p>
			<p>
				The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike
				bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.
			</p>
			<h4>Delvers into Secrets</h4>
			<p>
				Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known, but
				many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully
				aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the
				outer void.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if they don't intend to use the
				power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals. which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons
				often drive warlocks toward adventure.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Warlock</h4>
			<p>
				As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with
				your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual thal would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron
				find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?
			</p>
			<p>
				Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of
				small favors you can do between adventures.
			</p>
			<p>
				What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it's
				not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated
				by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward their patron, also consider how things look from the patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron a
				friend and ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?
			</p>
			<p>
				How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among
				tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries. Do you know
				other servants of your patron?

					<h4>Special Terms of the Pact</h4>
					<p>
						A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a pact—what a warlock must do to receive a patron's
						favor—are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the
						other requirements of their pacts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Does your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's not
						to say it couldn't still happen.

					<h4>Binding Mark</h4>
					<p>
						Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark makes it clear—to those who know about such things—that the individual
						in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid
						the difficulties it might bring.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source of
						pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every warlock gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the
					warlock spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting abilily for warlock spells. You can use an arcane focus (see the "Items" page) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock
					table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your
					choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn
					a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell
					from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the levet of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of
					1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell
					slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=Thunderwave"><i>Thunderwave</i></a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Eldritch Versatility</h4>
				<p>
					Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following representing a change of focus in your occult studies:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.</li>
					<li>Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.</li>
					<li>If you're 12<sup>th</sup> level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.</p>
				<h4>Eldritch invocations</h4>
				<p>
					In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two
					eldritch invocations of your choice.  When you gain cerlain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.
					Additionally, when you gain a level, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.<br>
					<b><i>Your invocation options are detailed at the bottom of this page.</i></b>
				</p>
				<h4>Pact Boon</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right; font-size:90%;">
					<h4><i>Your Pact Boon</i></h4>
					<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Pact of the Chain:</b> Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey
						and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.<br>
						<b>Pact of the Blade:</b> If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black
						metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone carved to look like a terrible, unblinking
						eye embedded in its head.<br>
						<b>Pact of the Tome:</b> Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome
						bound in demon hide studded wilh iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gíft of the Fiend. Or it could be the
						tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact wilh the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice:<br><br>
					<b>Pact of the Chain</b><br>
					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=FindFamiliar"><i>Find Familiar</i></a> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the
					spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Imp"><b>imp</b></a>,
					<a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Pseudodragon"><b>pseudodragon</b></a>, <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Quasit"><b>quasit</b></a>, or <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Sprite"><b>sprite</b></a>. Additionally, when
					you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own.<br><br>
					<b>Pact of the Blade</b><br>
					You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are
					proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is
					more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.<br>
					You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a
					short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient
					weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
					appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.<br><br>
					<b>Pact of the Tome</b><br>
					Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those
					cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This
					ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.<br><br>
					<b>Pact of the Talisman</b><br>
					Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add 1d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into
					a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.<br>
					If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous
					amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.
				</p>
				<h4>Mystic Arcanum</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once
					without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
				</p>
				<p>
					At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13<sup>th</sup> level, one 8th-level spell at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and one
					9th-level spell at 17<sup>th</sup> level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Eldritch Master</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid
					to regain all your expended warlock spell slots. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Your Otherworldly Patron</h2>
			<p>
				The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence — not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to
				different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to
				their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivaIs.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- The Archfey -->
				<summary><h4>The Archfey</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and
					sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
					ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>
				<p>
					The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
				</p>

				</table>
				<h4>Fey Presence</h4>
				<p>
					Your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube
					originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> or <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> by you (your choice) until the end
					of your next turn.<br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Misty Escape</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn <a href="./combat.html?f=Invisible">invisible</a> and teleport up to 60 feet to an
					unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.<br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
					short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Beguiling Defenses</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts
					to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by
					you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Dark Delirium</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw
					against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> or <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell).
					This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.<br>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see
					and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.<br>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- The Celestial -->
				<summary><h4>The Celestial</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your
					pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times,
					your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, and a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among
					mortals for now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>
				<p>
					The Celestial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

				<h4>Bonus Cantrips</h4>
				<p>
					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=Light"><i>Light</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=SacredFlame"><i>Sacred Flame</i></a> cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don't
					count against your number of cantrips known.
				</p>
				<h4>Healing Light</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a
					bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum
					one). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Radiant Soul</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals
					radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.
				</p>
				<h4>Celestal Resilience</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
					Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Searing Vengeance</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to
					your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet
					of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is <a href="./combat.html?f=Blinded">blinded</a> until the end of the current turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long
					rest.

					<h4><i>Note to Dungeon Masters</i></h4>
					<p>
						The Contract Warlock has the potential to accrue a wide array of benefits for themselves, and it would be easy to do so via making deals with NPCs. The main component for keeping this in
						check is your ability and willingness to portray how NPCs would react to giving up portions of themselves or becoming hindered due to the terms of a contract. In the same way it may seem
						easy for a player to gain a huge amount of powerful magic items if they have the gold and time to find them in shops, ultimately it is your responsibility to moderate what NPCs will
						tolerate and what benefits you accept the Contract Warlock having. This class is intentionally powerful and complicated as it mimics a fraction of the contract-for-power dynamic inherent to
						warlocks from the start. Safeguards have been added to hopefully help keep things from running off the rails, but ultimately both you and your players may need to have a discussion before
						beginning a campaign with this subclass about what is acceptable. Also, this is not a sub-class for beginners due to its complexity
					</p>
				</div></div>
				<p>
					All warlocks draw their power from the patrons they enter into bargains with. However, a select few take this as an opportunity to study these arcane contracts and the process of negotiating
					them with the ultimate goal of being able to forge them. Though still devoted to their patron, these warlocks eschew the traditional path to power and instead draw their strength by making
					deals in a manner similar to their own master.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>

					Your focus on magical deal making has gifted you with an expanded list of spells to choose from when you learn warlock spells. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

				<h4>Assessing Eye</h4>
				<p>
					Your patron has given you uncanny insight into others so that you may better appeal to them in the process of making deals. After spending 1 minute studying another creature you can see, you
					may learn one of the following pieces of information about that creature: a goal it desperately wishes to achieve, a line it is not willing to cross, behavioral traits that it abhors in others,
					or behavioral traits it finds endearing. Once you use this ability on a creature you may not use it on them again for 24 hours.
				</p>
				<h4>Pact Bound</h4>
				<p>
					Despite your focus on pacts and contracts, you are still bound to an outside entity from which you draw power. Choose a starting feature from another warlock subclass. You gain that feature.
				</p>
				<h4>Broker an Accord</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, You have learned to back up a deal or contract with arcane power, and in turn you are able to create contracts which are more firm in their terms than those
					bound by mere honor. You may flavor the mechanism of your contract binding to be anything you wish, such as a parchment with the terms written in blood or an etched rune stone.<br>
					Contracts are created between two consenting individuals, known as parties. As contracts require perfect consent, a creature that is mentally hindered, charmed, controlled, or being magically
					manipulated in any way may not become a party to a contract. However a party in control of their own faculties can be coerced or decieved into agreeing to anything, as long as they themselves
					decide to ratify the contract. Before a contract is ratified, both parties have an opportunity to inspect it for alterations, ensuring that only the components agreed upon are enacted. The
					contract's components apply exactly as written, giving no specific consideration to a party's intent when ratifying it.<br>
					Contracts have 3 components to them: terms, duration, and damage clauses:
				</p><br>
				<p class="invocation">
					<b>Terms</b><br>
					Terms are what effects, items, or behaviors are being agreed upon. Traditionally these take the form of fragments of a soul, riches, or promises of power, but can be truly anything. Each term
					comes with a Deal Value (DV) and in order for a contract to be valid both parties must agree on what terms are in the contract. The Contract Terms table contains a list of suggested terms and
					their associated DV. Once both parties have agreed upon terms, the DV of those terms are added together to calculate the total DV of the contract. The same term may be added to a contract
					multiple times with each additional instance adding its DV to the DV total.
				</p>
				<p class="invocation">
					<b>Duration</b><br>
					The duration of a contract is the period of time in which it is valid. After the agreed upon time expires, the contract is nullified and both parties are under no further obligation. Durations
					increase the total DV of the contract as each has an associated DV multiplier. For example, a contract with an initial DV of 10 set by the terms with a duration of one month (x2) would have a
					total DV of 20. The Contract Durations table has a list of durations along with their associated DV multipliers. When a contract is nullified either because its duration is completed or because
					one of the parties breaks one or more of the terms, all effects of the contract end with the exception of material goods such as items or money that changed hands as part of the contract. As
					such, terms which define the exchange of physical items are generally considered payments and rarely can cause the contract to be broken (even in the case where they are later stolen back).
				</p>
				<p class="invocation">
					<b>Damage Clauses</b><br>
					Of course, contracts would bear no weight if they did not come with penalties for breaking them. When a contract is forged, both parties must agree on one or more damage clauses to attach to
					the contract. The clauses need not be the same for both parties. If either party ends the contract early or breaks one of the terms, they suffer all of the agreed upon effects of the contract's
					damage clauses and then the contract is nullified. Effects of a damage clause last for the duration they specify and may persist even after the contract is nullified. The Contract Damage
					Clauses table contains a list of damage clause suggestions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Either party in a contract may suggest a term or damage clause not in the tables below. In such a case, it is up to the DM to set an appropriate Deal Value for what is being proposed. It is 
					suggested that only DMs which are ready to mediate the contract forging process should allow this, as it can increase the complexity of the contract tremendously and increases the risk of a
					contract becoming too powerful.<br>
					You may forge a contract with a maximum DV of 20. This maximum value is increased to 30 at 10th level and 40 at 14th level. In addition you may have a total of 2 active contracts at a time. The
					number of active contracts you may have is increased to 4 at 10th level and 6 at 14th level.
				</p>
				<h4>Silver-Tongued Devil</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain proficiency in the Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) skills. For each of these skills that you are already proficient in when you gain this
					feature you may instead choose a skill that relies on either Charisma or Intelligence to become proficient in. Your proficiency bonus is also doubled for any ability checks you make using the
					Persuasion or Deception skill.
				</p>
				<h4>Exploit Loophole</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, As a bonus action you may enact a clever series of loopholes based on logic or verbage you drafted into one of your contracts. For the next minute you are not
					affected by any number of the terms of a single contract that is affecting you. Any terms of that contract that affect the other party continue to affect them as though nothing had changed. You
					may use this feature once per short rest.

					Some warlocks gain their eldritch power from the very cosmos, answering to entities of space, the constellations, planets, and moons. A warlock swearing fealty to a cosmic patron typically
					believes they speak to gods, or god-like beings, but these entities are shrouded in mystery, their appearance incomprehensible and horrible, and their divine power is bestowed into the warlock
					from the stars and galaxies beyond. Your cosmic connection infuses you with an otherworldly cosmic appearance or essence. Choose one or more of the attributes listed on the right, decide your

					damage instead of force damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Cosmic Guidance</h4>

					<li><b><i>Lightspeed:</i></b> As a bonus action, you can consume a comet to teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can have a maximum number of orbiting comets equal to your proficiency bonus. As long as you have comets, you glow with bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
					The comets last until you finish a short or long rest, or until you dismiss them (no action required)
				</p>
				<h4>Meteoric Impact</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, Once per turn when you hit a creature with <a href="./spellst.html?l=EldritchBlast"><i>Eldritch Blast</i></a>, you can cause the beam to explode. Each creature
					within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage.<br>
					The damage increases to 4d6 damage at 14<sup>th</sup> level, and to 5d6 damage at 17<sup>th</sup> level.
				</p>
				<h4>Supernova</h4>

				<h4>Enthrall Companion</h4>
				<p>
					You can enthrall a humanoid that accompanies you on your adventures to fight alongside you. Choose a humanoid that is Large or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your
					proficiency bonus to your thrall's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skill checks it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in
					its stat block, or four times your warlock level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.<br>
					Your thrall obeys your commands as best as it can and takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command your thrall where to move (no action required by you). You can use
					your bonus action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, your thrall takes the Dodge action. If you are incapacitated or
					absent, your thrall acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. Your thrall never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.<br>
					If your thrall dies, you can obtain a new one by charming a humanoid that isn't hostile to you and that meets the requirements (Requires you to use a spell or ability which charms on them. If
					you charm multiple creatures at once, you can choose any one of them that meets the requirements to be your thrall). You may only have one thrall at a time, and you may free your thrall from
					their hypnosis at any time, though they will be aware of what you did to them when you do so.<br>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level you can enthrall a humanoid up to challenge rating 1 or lower, and if you command your thrall to take the Attack action, it can make two attacks, or take the
					Multiattack action if it has that action.At 17<sup>th</sup> level, you can enthrall a humanoid of challenge rating 2 or lower.
				</p>
				<h4>Devoted Thrall</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, while your thrall can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws and cannot be charmed by anyone other than you.
				</p>
				<h4>Devil's Due</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned to consume your thrall's life force, channeling it through yourself and ultimately to your patron. As an action, you may roll any number of
					your thrall's hit dice. You regain that many hit points, and your thrall takes that much necrotic damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Passionate Defense</h4>

					You have plunged into a pact with the deeps. An entity of the ocean, the Elemental Plane of Water, or another otherworldly sea now allows you to draw on its thalassic power. Is it merely using
					you to learn about terrestrial realms, or does it want you to open cosmic floodgates and drown the world? Perhaps you were born into a generational cult that venerates the Fathomless and its
					spawn. Or you might have been shipwrecked and on the brink of drowning when your patron's grasp offered you a chance at life. Whatever the reason for your pact, the sea and its unknown depths
					call to you. Entities of the deep that might empower a warlock include krakens, ancient water elementals, godlike hallucinations dreamed into being by kuo-toa, merfolk demigods, and sea hag
					covens.

				<h4>Tentacle of the Deeps</h4>
				<p>
					You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 60
					feet of you. When you create the tentacle, you can make a melee spell attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by
					10ft until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10<sup>th</sup> level, the damage increases to 2d8. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the
					attack.
				</p>
				<p>The tentacle lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature to create another tentacle. You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
					expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
				<h4>Gift of the Sea</h4>
				<p>You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you can breathe underwater.</p>
				<h4>Oceanic Soul</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you are even more at home in the depths. You gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, when you are fully submerged, any creature that is also fully submerged
					can understand your speech, and you can understand theirs. 
				</p>
				<h4>Guardian Coil</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and others, interposing itself between them and harm. When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10
					feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to that creature by ld8. When you reach 10<sup>th</sup> level, the damage reduced by the
					tentacle increases to 2d8.
				</p>
				<h4>Grasping Tentacles</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=GraspingTentacles"><i>Grasping Tentacles</i></a> spell. It doesn't count against the number of spells you know. You can also cast
					it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary
					hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover, damage can't break your concentration on this spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Fathomless Plunge</h4>
				<p>
					When you reach 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport yourself and up to five other creatures that you can see
					within 30 feet of you. If a creature is unwilling, it can succeed on a strengh or dexterity saving throw (its choice) versus your spell save DC to not be teleported. Amid a whirl of tentacles,
					you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of
					the others. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

				<h4>Dark One's Blessing</h4>

					When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
				</p>
				<h4>Dark One's Own Luck</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll.
					You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

				<h4>Fiendish Resilience</h4>

				<h4>Hurl Through Hell</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles
					through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10
					psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

					Your patron gifts you a magical vessel that grants you a measure of the genie's power. The vessel is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. You decide
					what the object is, or you can determine what it is randomly by rolling on the Genie's Vessel table.
				</p>
				<p>
					The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the vessel is destroyed or you
					lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still
					exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.
				</p>
				<p>
					While you are touching the vessel, you can use it in the following ways:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Bottled Respite</b><br>
					As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius
					cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel
					as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you
					die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is
					destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Genie's Wrath</b><br>
					Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron:
					bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).
				</p>
				<h4>Elemental Gift</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you begin to take on characteristics of your patron's kind. You have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder
					(djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this
					bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Sanctuary Vessel</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you enter your Genie's Vessel via the Bottled Respite feature, you can choose up to five willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you, and
					the chosen creatures are drawn into the vessel with you.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a bonus action, you can eject any number of creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed. In addition, anyone (including you) who
					remains within the vessel for at least 10 minutes gains the benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points they regain if they spend any
					Hit Dice as part of a short rest there.
				</p>
				<h4>Limited Wish</h4>
				<p>
					When you reach 14<sup>th</sup> level, you entreat your patron to grant you a small wish.<br>
					As an action, you can speak your desire to your Genie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 6<sup>th</sup> level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action. The spell can be from any class's
					spell list, and you don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, including costly components; the spell simply takes effect as part of this action. Once you use this feature, you can't use
					it again until you finish 1d4 long rests.

					Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known

				</p>
				<h4>Entropic Ward</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you,
					you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.
					Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Thought Shield</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic
					damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. 
				</p>
				<h4>Create Thrall</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then
					<a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you until a <a href="./spells.html?l=RemoveCurse"><i>Remove Curse</i></a> spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can

				<summary><h4>The Hexblade</h4></summary>

					<a href="./items.html?l=Blackrazor"><i class="lgndmagit">Blackrazor</i></a> is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force
					behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to
					weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she

				<h4 id="HexbladesCurse">Hexblade's Curse</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1
					minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus against the cursed target.</li>
					<li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</li>
					<li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<h4>Hex Warrior</h4>
				<p>
					You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
				</p>
				<p>
					The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with
					and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts
					until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.
				</p>
				<h4>Accursed Specter</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its Spirit to rise from its corpse
					as a specter, the statistics for which are on the Monsters page. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which
					has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).
				</p>
				<p>
					The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again
					until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Armor of Hexes</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the
					attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.
				</p>
				<h4>Master of Hexes</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse
					to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated. When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously
					cursed creature.

					inhabit their bodies, answering to some ancient and eldritch thing from beyond comprehension. This entity creates a symbiotic relationship with the host, granting them powers while reshaping and
					twisting their form.

				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>

					The Symbiote lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

				<h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
				<p>
					While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Reshape Flesh</h4>
				<p>
					As an action, you can take on a reshaped form, which lasts until you become incapacitated, use an action to change back, or use this feature again. When you do, choose from one of the reshaped
					forms below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Inverse Kneecaps:</i></b> Your legs become more powerful, and your knees now bend the opposite direction. While in this form, you increase your walking speed by 10 feet, and you can
						double your long and high jump distance.</li>
					<li><b><i>Aquatic Attributes:</i></b> You grow gills and your skin becomes slimy, the flesh between your fingers and toes becomes webbed. While in this form, you can breathe underwater, and gain
						a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
					<li><b><i>Natural Weapons:</i></b> You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage,
						as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. You can use your Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls. The damage of your unarmed
						strikes increases as you gain levels in this class: 2d6 damage beginning at 10th level, and 3d6 damage at 14th level.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Body Modification</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you choose your reshaped form, you can choose any two options available to you. You also gain the following additional options when you take on a reshaped
					form.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Gelatin Bones:</i></b> Your skin looks loose and saggy as you struggle to maintain your structure. You can now fit into spaces as small as one inch in diameter and gain advantage on
						Stealth checks.</li>
					<li><b><i>Change Appearance:</i></b> You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration,
						and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different
						size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. For example, if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal.</li>
					<li><b><i>Combat Instincts:</i></b> You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, your natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered
						magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
					<li><b><i>Spider Claws:</i></b> Your hands and feet grow strange mucus-slicked insectoid features that allow you to climb surfaces. You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed and can
						stick to ceilings as well without needing to make an ability check.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Greater Flesh-shaping</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the following additional options when you take on a reshaped form.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Aerial Adaptation:</i></b> Feathered or batlike wings rip out of your back, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed</li>
					<li><b><i>Toxic Fumes:</i></b> A cloud of noxious gas seeps from your pores, you appear sickly, and green slime oozes from your pores. You have disadvantage on Charisma checks while in this
						form, but any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes 2d6 poison damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
					<li><b><i>Hardened Skin:</i></b> You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Physiological Mastery</h4>
				<p>
					You can choose any three available options when you transform using your Reshape Flesh feature. Additionally, you are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form against your will.

				<p>
					You've made a pact with a deathless being, a creature that defies the cycle and life and death, forsaking its mortal shell so it might eternally pursue its unfathomable ambitions. For such
					beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life's hourglass. Having once been mortal themselves, these ancient undead know
					firsthand the paths of ambition and the routes past the doors of death. They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.
					Beings of this type include the demilich Acererak, the vampire tyrant Kas the Bloody-Handed, the githyanki lich-queen Vlaakith, the dracolich Dragotha, the undead pharaoh Ankhtepot, and the
					elusive Darklord, Azalin Rex.

				<h4>Form of Dread</h4>
				<p>
					You manifest an aspect of your patron's dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
					expended uses when you finish a long rest. You gain the following benefits while transformed:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.</li>
					<li>Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of you
						until the end of your next turn.</li>
					<li>You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your body might
					glow with glyphs from ancient funerary rites and be surrounded by desert winds, suggesting your mummy patron.
				</p>
				<h4>Grave Touched</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your patron's powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. In addition, once during each of your turns, when
					you hit a creature with an attack roll and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage. While you are using your Form of Dread, you can roll one
					additional damage die when determining the necrotic damage the target takes.
				</p>
				<h4>Necrotic Husk</h4>
				<p>
					When you reach 10<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to undeath and necrotic energy saturates your body. You have resistance to necrotic damage. If you are transformed using your Form of Dread,
					you instead become immune to necrotic damage. In addition, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and cause your body to erupt with
					deathly energy. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your warlock level. You then
					<a href="./combat.html?l=Exhaustion">gain 1 level of exhaustion</a>. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish 1d4 long rests.
				</p>
				<h4>Spirit Projection</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, your spirit can become untethered from your physical form. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious
					and in a state of suspended animation. Your spirit resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics but not your possessions. Any damage or other effects that
					apply to your spirit or physical body affects the other. Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When
					your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit's space (your choice). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
					long rest. While projecting your spirit, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
					<li>When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn't require verbal or somatic components or material components that lack a gold cost.</li>
					<li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end
						your turn inside a creature or an object.</li>
					<li>While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
				</ul>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- The Undying -->
				<summary title="this is totally distinct from the undead I swear"><h4>The Undying</h4></summary>

				<p>
					Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize—like all power—comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal
					lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death. Beings of this sort include Vecna, Lord of the
					Hand and the Eye; the dread Iuz; the lich-queen Vol; the Undying Court of Aerenal; Vlaakith, lich-queen of the githyanki; and the deathless wizard Fistandantalus.

				<h4>Among the Dead</h4>
				<p>
					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=SparetheDying"><i>Spare the Dying</i></a> cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC
					(an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of a <a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> spell). On a failed save, the creature
					must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead
					is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Defy Death</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier
					(minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with spare the dying. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long
					rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Undying Nature</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from
					finishing short and long rests. In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.
				</p>
				<h4>Indestructible Life</h4>
				<p>
					When you reach 14<sup>th</sup> level, you partake of some of the true secrets of the Undying. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d8 +your warlock level.
					Additionally, if you put a severed body part of yours back in place when you use this feature, the part reattaches. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or
					long rest.

			<h2>Wizard</h2>
			<p>
				Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battletield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes
				her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is
				complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.
			</p>
			<p>
				Crouching on the fioor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions
				more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left
			</p>
			<p>
				Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive tire, arcing
				lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells
				change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
			</p>
			<h4>Scholars of the Arcane</h4>
			<p>
				Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting
				of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fieeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise
				attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in
				experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.
			</p>
			<p>
				The price that wizards pay for their mastery is that most valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of study, instruction, and experimentation to learn how to harness magical energy and carry
				spells around in one's own mind. For adventuring wizards and other spellcasters who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, the studying never ends, nor does the quest for knowledge and
				power.
			</p>
			<h4>The Lure of Knowledge</h4>
			<p>
				Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the
				multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous
				wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic
				that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating a Wizard</h4>
			<p>
				Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for
				it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? What drew you
				forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
				Perhaps you're simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

					<h4>Ambition</h4>
					<p>
						Few aspiring wizards undertake the study of magic without some personal goal in mind. Many wizards use their spells as a tool to produce a tangible benefit, in material goods or in status,
						for themselves or their companions. For others, the theoretical aspect of magic might have a strong appeal, pushing those wizards to seek out knowledge that supports new theories of the
						arcane or confirms old ones. Beyond the obvious, why does your wizard character study magic, and what do you want to achieve? If you haven't given these questions much thought, you can do so
						now, and the answers you come up with will likely affect how your future unfolds.

						Endless hours of solitary study and research can have a negative effect on anyone's social skills. Wizards, who are a breed apart to begin with, are no exception. An odd mannerism or two is
						not necessarily a drawback, though; an eccentricity of this sort is usually harmless and could provide a source of amusement or serve as a calling card of sorts. If your character has an
						eccentricity, is it a physical tic or a mental one? Are you well known in some circles because of it? Do you fight to overcome it, or do you embrace this minor claim to fame of yours?

				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Your Spellbook</i></h4>
					<p>
						The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the
						multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient
						library.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Copying a Spell into the Book:</b> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can
						spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the
						wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the
						spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to
						record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Replacing the Book:</b> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new
						spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the
						copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook
						requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The Book's Appearance:</b> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you
						received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous
						spellbook in a mishap. See the dropdown section under "Creating a Wizard" for further suggestions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and
					"Spell Lists" for the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for wizard spells. You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
					column of the Wizard table.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spellbook &amp; Learning Spells</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, your a spellbook contains six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook.
					Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might also find other spells that you can add to your spellbook, see
					the "Your Spellbook" sidebar.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>
					The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
					all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
					You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level
					(minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3<sup>rd</sup>-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.
					With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
					<a href="./spells.html?l=MagicMissile"><i>Magic Missile</i></a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>
					You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and
					gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ritual Casting</b><br>
					You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>
				<p>
					You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can
					have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you're a 4<sup>th</sup>-level wizard,
					you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
				</p>
				<h4>Cantrip Formulas</h4>
				<p>
					At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult those
					formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.
				</p>
				<h4>Spell Mastery</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your
					spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell
					slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.
				</p>
				<h4>Signature Spells</h4>
				<p>
					When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You
					always have these spells  prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do
					so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
				</p>

			<h2>Subclasses: Arcane Traditions</h2>
			<p>
				The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex
				study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories
				called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of lllusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other
				institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Bladesinger -->
				<summary><h4>Bladesinging</h4></summary>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Bladesinger Styles</i></h4>
					<p>
						From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesinging has been tied to the sword, more specifically the longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of
						Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction.
						Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after
						specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of
						their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Cat</b><br>
						Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style
						focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which
						they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Bird</b><br> 
						Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and
						many maneuvers in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one. Raven style uses a pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Snake</b><br>
						Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters
						punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease
						favored by the style.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Those who see a bladesinger in battle never forget the sight. Surrounded by chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act in concert, meshing
					awe-inspiring beauty with fearsome deadliness. When the bladesinger's sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, the bladesong has begun—and
					it might be the last thing the bladesinger's enemy hears. Bladesingers appear to be almost casual in combat, deflecting opponents' blades while elegantly moving into position to score hits in
					return. A bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free for spellcasting or to manipulate a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives them the
					freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial arts, which allow both magical and physical attacks to flow freely. Originally created by elves, this
					tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways. Few have the honor of being inducted into the ranks of the bladesingers. One must have the mind
					necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancers.
				</p>
				<h4>Training in War and Song</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice. You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already
					have it.
				</p>
				<h4>Bladesong</h4>
				<p>
					You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. You can
					use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an
					attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required). While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
					<li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
					<li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li>
					<li>You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of + 1)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those
					attacks.
				</p>
				<h4>Song of Defense</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce
					that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.
				</p>
				<h4>Song of Victory</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of + 1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is active.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Scribe -->
				<summary><h4>Order of Scribes</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Magic of the book—that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see
					wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge. Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the
					most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value
					spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!
				</p>
				<h4>Wizardly Quill</h4>
				<p>
					As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die. The magic quill has the following properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.</li>
					<li>The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.</li>
					<li>You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Awakened Spellbook</h4>
				<p>
					Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spell book. While you are holding the book, it grants
					you the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</li>
					<li>When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's
						formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend</li>
					<li>When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish
						a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spell book to which you're attuned. At the
					end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still
					existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.
				</p>
				<h4>Manifest Mind</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny
					spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
					It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice). While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
					The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required). As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you
					or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal
					to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts
					<a href="./spells.html?l=DispelMagic"><i>Dispel Magic</i></a> on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action. Once you conjure the
					mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.
				</p>
				<h4>Master Scrivener</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell
					from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1 st or 2nd level and must have a
					casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The
					scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					You are also adept at <a href="./items.html?l=craftmagit">crafting </a><a href="./items.html?s=Spell Scroll"><i><span class="comnmagit">Spe</span><span class="uncmmagit">ll</span>
					<span class="raremagit">Sc</span><span class="vryrmagit">ro</span><span class="lgndmagit">lls</span></i></a>. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use
					your Wizardly Quill.
				</p>
				<h4>One with the Word</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on
					all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save
					yourself. Roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells
					vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book
					to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you
					finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Abjuration -->
				<summary><h4>School of Abjuration</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards_cropped/7183277.jpg">
				<p>
					The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You
					understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation. Called abjurers,
					members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portaIs to other planes of existence must be
					closed.

					The gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Ward</h4>
				<p>
					You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on
					yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage
					instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an
					abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a
					long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Projected Ward</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage
					reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Abjuration</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast an abjuration spell that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability
					check.
				</p>
				<h4>Spell Resistance</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.

				<summary><h4>School of Conjuration</h4></summary>
				<p>
					As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As
					your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.
				</p>
				<h4>Conjuration Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Minor Conjuration</h4>
				<p>
					You can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on
					a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The object
					disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Benign Transportation</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied
					by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a
					conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.
				</p>
				<h4>Focused Conjuration</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Durable Summons</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell gains 30 temporary hit points.

				<summary><h4>School of Divination</h4></summary>
				<p>
					The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space,
					time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.
				</p>
				<h4>Divination Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Portent</h4>
				<p>
					Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability
					check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each
					foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
				</p>
				<h4>Expert Divination</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or
					higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.
				</p>
				<h4>The Third Eye</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or
					you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Darkvision:</b> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ethereal Sight:</b> You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Greater Comprehension:</b> You can read any language.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>See Invisibility:</b> You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
				</p>
				<h4>Greater Portent</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, the visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather
					than two.

				<p>
					As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay
					down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.
				</p>
				<h4>Enchantment Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Hypnotic Gaze</h4>
				<p>
					your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must
					succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be <a href="./combat.html?f=Charmed">charmed</a> by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is
					<a href="./combat.html?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a> and visibly dazed. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you
					move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage. Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial
					saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Instinctive Charm</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another
					creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to
					it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you
					finish a long rest. You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
				</p>
				<h4>Split Enchantment</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.
				</p>
				<h4>Alter Memories</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one
					creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed. Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the
					time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier
					(minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

				<summary><h4>School of Evocation</h4></summary>
				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/evocation.png">
				<p>
					You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in
					military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring
					tyrants.
				</p>
				<h4>Evocation Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Sculpt Spells</h4>
				<p>
					You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of
					them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a
					successful save.
				</p>
				<h4>Potent Cantrip</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature
					takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
				</p>
				<h4>Empowered Evocation</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any evocation spell you cast.
				</p>
				<h4>Overchannel</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that
					spell's first damage roll. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately
					after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
				</p>

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Illusion -->
				<summary><h4>School of Illusion</h4></summary>
				<p>
					You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the ilIusions crafted by your keen mind make the
					impossible seem real. Some illusionists—including many gnome wizards—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their ilIusions
					to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.
				</p>
				<h4>Illusion Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Minor Illusion</h4>
				<p>
					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=MinorIllusion"><i>Minor Illusion</i></a> cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice.
					<a href="./spells.html?l=MinorIllusion"><i>Minor Illusion</i></a> doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast <a href="./spells.html?l=MinorIllusion"><i>Minor Illusion</i></a>,
					you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Malleable Illusions</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's
					normal parameters for lhe illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.
				</p>
				<h4>Illusory Self</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you
					can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates. Once you use this feature, you
					can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Illusory Reality</h4>
				<p>
					By 14<sup>th</sup> level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can
					choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real
					for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross. The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm
					anyone.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Inscription -->
				<summary><h4>School of Inscription</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Arcanists who pursue the ancient art of inscription seek to wield words in the same manner one might a sword. Using both their own bodies and those of their foes, they are adept at inscribing
					spell effects such that they are more potent than when normally crafted. Many also utilize their own bodies as extensions of their spellbooks, ensuring they always have the spells they require
					prepared.
				</p>
				<h4>Inscription Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy spell with a range of Self or Touch into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Living Codex</h4>
				<p>
					Your can inscribe spells upon your own flesh, as you would in a spellbook. You may store a number of spells equal to your profiency bonus by writing them upon your body with specially made ink.
					Inscribing spells upon yourself this way requires 50gp worth of material components and 2 hours for each level of spell inscribed, same as a spell inscribed in your spellbook. A spell can be
					removed from your skin by spending 100 gp of enchanted soaps and 2 hours scrubbing. Only 1 spell can be inscribed on a given portion of your body at a time.<br>
					One spell can be written upon each limb, one upon the torso, and one upon the head or face. You always have these spells prepared and they do not count against the number of spells you can
					prepare each day.
				</p>
				<h4>Compose Boon</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell of 3rd level or lower with a range of Self or Touch and you choose yourself as the target, you may spend 1 minute to write the name of
					the spell or an appropriate word to describe it upon your body. While a spell is inscribed this way, you are considered to be concentrating on it, but it doesn't end if you cast another
					concentration spell. When you make a concentration saving throw, the DC is increased by 5 for each spell you are concentrating on beyond the first. When your concentration is broken all, spells
					you were concentrating on end. If a spell written upon your body ends, the inscription fades from your flesh.
				</p>
				<h4>True Statement</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, when you gain this feature, you may choose a word or statement that speaks to the core essence of your being. That word or statement is magically inscribed permanently
					upon your skin by ink, scarring, or another appropriate method of your choosing.<br>
					Choose a spell of 3rd level or lower that fits thematically with that statement and has a range of Self or Touch. For example, one might choose “nobody notices me” for the statement, and choose
					Invisibility for the spell. This spell can be from any class' spell list or school of magic and you are considered to always have this spell prepared. You may cast this spell, eschewing somatic
					and verbal components, and without using a spell slot. If the spell has a range of Touch, you must choose yourself as the target. You may use this feature two times, regaining spent uses after
					finishing a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Branding Incantation</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, after you cast a spell of 5th level or lower with a range of Touch, a duration of Instantaneous, and you either hit with an attack roll or the target fails a
					saving throw against that spell, you may mark the target's skin with the words and sigils of the spell. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, to a
					minimum of 1. You regain all spent uses when you finish a long rest.<br>
					At the beginning of their turn, any creatures marked in this way must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they suffer the spell's effects once again,
					automatically failing any saving throws against it. On a success, the mark fades without any further effect.

				<img loading="lazy" class="raceimg" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/1/10/Tharja_Skill.png">
				<p>
					The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things.
					As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate. Most people see
					necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.
				</p>
				<h4>Necromancy Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Grim Harvest</h4>
				<p>
					You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points
					equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if it is a necromancy spell. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.
				</p>
				<h4>Undead Thralls</h4>
				<p>
					At 6<sup>th</sup> level, you add the <a href="./spells.html?l=AnimateDead"><i>Animate Dead</i></a> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast
					<a href="./spells.html?l=AnimateDead"><i>Animate Dead</i></a>, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate. In addition, whenever
					you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.</li>
					<li>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Inured to Undeath</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects. You gain
					resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. 
				</p>
				<h4>Command Undead</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60
					feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you
					and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving
					throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

				<p>
					You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of
					creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge. Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning
					people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and
					destroy worlds.
				</p>
				<h4>Transmutation Savant</h4>
				<p>
					The gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.
				</p>
				<h4>Minor Alchemy</h4>
				<p>
					You can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed
					entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materiais. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can
					transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
				</p>
				<h4>Transmuter's Stone</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A
					creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet</li>
					<li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered</li>
					<li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws</li>
					<li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one
					ceases to function.
				</p>
				<h4>Shapechanger</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you add the <a href="./spells.html?l=Polymorph"><i>Polymorph</i></a> spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Polymorph"><i>Polymorph</i></a> without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or
					lower. Once you cast <a href="./spells.html?l=Polymorph"><i>Polymorph</i></a> in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using
					an available spell slot.
				</p>
				<h4>Master Transmuter</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of
					the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Major Transformation:</b><br>
					You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the
					object to transform it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Panacea:</b><br>
					You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Restore Life:</b><br>
					You cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=RaiseDead"><i>Raise Dead</i></a> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in
					your spellbook.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Restore Youth:</b><br>
					You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years.<br>This effect doesn't extend the creature's
					lifespan.

			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- War Mage -->
				<summary><h4>War Magic</h4></summary>
				<p>
					A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools.
					It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses. Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their
					magic as both a weapon and armor, are source superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard,
					while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them. In great battles, a war mage
					often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical
					response: “What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?”
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Deflection</h4>
				<p>
					You have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm. When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against
					that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw. When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Tactical Wit</h4>
				<p>
					Your keen ability to assess tactical situations allows you to act quickly in battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Power Surge</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells. In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge. You can store a
					maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a
					spell with <a href="./spells.html?l=DispelMagic"><i>Dispel Magic</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=Counterspell"><i>Counterspell</i></a>, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the
					spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge. Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power
					surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.
				</p>
				<h4>Durable Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, the magic you channel helps ward off harm. While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.
				</p>
				<h4>Deflecting Shroud</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused with deadly magic. When you use your Arcane Deflection feature, you can cause magical energy to arc from you. Up to three

				Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells
				and inventions. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to
				inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a
				job as well as an artificer.
			</p>
			<h4>Artificiers in Many Worlds</h4>
			<p>
				Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives
				have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations. In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of
				Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in
				Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.
			</p>
			<!-- Artificers don't have any "creating a" or drop-down flavour either. I guess flavour and inspirational text was put on the backburner after Xanathar's for some reason -->
			<h4>Quick Build</h4>
			<p>
				You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan
				background.

			</ul>
			<details class="classdetails"> <!-- The stuff that every artificer gets goes in here -->
				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to
					produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the artificer spell list. Intelligence is
					your spellcasting ability for artificer spells.
				</p>
				<p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with
					this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell always has a material component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the
					Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting
					focus.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips
					Known column of the Artificer table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer can trips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b><br>
					The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or
					higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br>
					You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When
					you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
					have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5<sup>th</sup>-level artificer, you have four 1 st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can
					include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't
					remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br>
					You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute
					per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ritual Casting</b><br>
					You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
				</p>
				<h4>Magical Tinkering</h4>
				<p>
					You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an
					action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>
					<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording
						can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>
					<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>
					<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this
					feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
					of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>
				<h4>Infuse Item</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items. Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that
					rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The descriptions of the infusions on the bottom of this page detail the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting
					magic item requires attunement. Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level. Unless an infusion's description says
					otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Infusions Known</b><br>
					When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infusions" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your
					choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer
					infusions you learned with a new one.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Infusing an Item</b><br>
					Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of
					objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later,
					you must do so using the normal process for attunement <a href="./items.html?l=attunement">(see the attunement rules on the Items Page)</a>. Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when
					you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion. You can
					infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects,
					and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions,
					the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies. If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its
					space.
				</p>
				<h4>The Right Tool for the Job</h4>
				<p>
					By 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an
					unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical,
					and they vanish when you use this feature again.
				</p>
				<h4>Tool Expertise</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
				</p>
				<h4>Flash of Genius</h4>
				<p>
					At 7<sup>th</sup> level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw,
					you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all
					expended uses when you finish a long rest
				</p>
				<h4>Magic Item Adept</h4>
				<p>
					by 10<sup>th</sup> level, you've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can attune to up to four magic items at once.</li>
					<li>If you craft a magic item with a rarity of <span class="comnmagit">common</span> or <span class="uncmmagit">uncommon</span>, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half
						as much of the usual gold.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Spell-Storing Item</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 11<sup>th</sup> level, You can store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting
					focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared). While holding the object, a
					creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays
					in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object
				</p>
				<h4>Magic Item Savant</h4>
				<p>
					At 14<sup>th</sup> level, your skill with magic deepens:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can attune to up to five magic items at once.</li>
					<li>You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Magic item Master</h4>
				<p>Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.</p>
				<h4>Soul of Artifice</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, You develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.</li>
					<li>If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and

				<h4>Tool Proficiency</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
				</p>
				<h4>Alchemist Spells</h4>
				<p>
					You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't
					count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

					Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when someone
					drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you
					touch, and you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table. Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create
					with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th

				</ul>
				<h4>Chemical Mastery</h4>
				<p>
					By 15<sup>th</sup> level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.</li>
					<li>You can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=GreaterRestoration"><i>Greater Restoration</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=Heal"><i>Heal</i></a> without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use alchemist's supplies as

				<h4>Arcane Armor</h4>
				<p>
					Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools
					in hand. The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die. You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
					<li>You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
					<li>The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor
						replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.</li>
					<li>You can doff or don the armor as an action.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Armor Model</h4>
				<p>
					You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it. Each
					model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. You can change the
					armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Guardian.</b><br>
					You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Thunder Gauntlets:</b> Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by
						the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks
						someone else.</li>
					<li><b>Defensive Field:</b> As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this
						bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Infiltrator.</b><br>
					You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Lightning Launcher:</b> A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long
					range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.</li>
					<li><b>Powered Steps:</b> Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
					<li><b>Dampening Field:</b> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as
					normal.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Extra Attack</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
				</p>
				<h4>Armor Modifications</h4>
				<p>
					At 9<sup>th</sup> level, you learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items
					feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor's
					model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.
				</p>
				<h4>Perfected Armor</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Guardian:</b> When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw
					against your spell save DC, pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack
					against it as part of this reaction. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Infiltrator:</b> Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light
					in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack
					hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

				<p>
					You've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a
					horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a
					long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present. When you create the cannon, you determine its
					appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. If
					it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the <a href="./spells.html?l=Mending"><i>Mending</i></a> spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6
					hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to
					activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.
				</p>
				<h4>Arcane Firearm</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 5<sup>th</sup> level, You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's
					tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The
					sigils otherwise last indefinitely. You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you
					gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled. 
				</p>
				<h4>Explosive Cannon</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 9<sup>th</sup> level, every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.</li>
					<li>As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving
						throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Fortified Position</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, you become a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with your Eldritch Cannon feature, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon
						emits.</li>
					<li>You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You
						determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.</li>

				</details>
				<h4>Steel Defender</h4>
				<p>
					Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which
					uses your proficiency bonus (PB), in several places. You determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics. At the end of a long
					rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if
					you die.
				</p>
				<p>
					In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the
					Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the
					defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. If the <a href="./spells.html?l=Mending"><i>Mending</i></a> spell is cast on the defender, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died
					within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The defender returns to
					life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

					By 9<sup>th</sup> level, You've learned new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can
					channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.</li>
					<li>Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a
					long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Improved Defender</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 15<sup>th</sup> level, your Arcane jolt and steel defender features become more powerful:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to 4d6.</li>
					<li>Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
					<li>Whenever your steel defender uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.</li>

			<img loading="lazy" class="mtg" style="float:right; width:45%; margin-top:5em; padding-bottom:2em;" src="../Stylefiles/classimg/apothecarytop.JPG">
			<h2>Apothecary</h2>
			<p>
				A bespectacled man stands at an operating table, studying the dissected monstrosity resting upon the slab. The crackle of electric conductors harmonize with his arcane mumblings as he takes up his
				scalpels and saws. As he finishes the final stitch, the creature's handtwitches and jolts to life once more. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cloaked in an acid-stained heavy coat, a tall half-elf brews tinctures and tonics. Her face is concealed behind thick black goggles and a heavy breathing mask as she performs an unusual combination
				of herbalism, alchemy, medicine, and magic. Her mixtures bubble and boil as she muses whether the cure will be worse than the disease.
			</p>
			<p>
				A lithe tiefling soothes a suffering patient as they draw a sample of contaminated blood. Lifting the vial to examine the liquid within, they pull upon eldritch energy to distill the sample into a
				pure contagion. Scribbling their findings down in a withered notebook, they add the vial to their collection of pathogens and scourges to use against their foes.
			</p>
			<p>
				An apothecary is a practiced medical expert and arcane magic user. They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some
				apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces
				to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can
				be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, andsome apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An
				apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose. Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive
				horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning
				forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world. They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the
				innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between,
				riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor.
			</p>
			<h4>Occult Practicioners</h4>
			<p>
				Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are
				deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work. Apothecaries may gain renown within some remote
				communities as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create
				toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies.
			</p>
			<h4>Creating an Apothecary</h4>
			<p>
				When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working towards a paracelcian ideal,
				seeking insights with the goal of helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save
				someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous
				chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells?
			</p>
			<p>
				All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to
				well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means
				to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories.
			</p>
			<h4>Quick Build</h4>
			<p>
				You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions:<br>
				First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the
				<a href="./spells.html?l=PoisonNeedle"><i>Poison Needle</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=SparetheDying"><i>Spare the Dying</i></a> cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Envenom"><i>Envenom</i></a> and <a href="./spells.html?l=HealingWord"><i>Healing Word</i></a>.

				<summary><h4>Generic Class Features</h4></summary>
				<h4>Your Formula Book</h4>
				<p>
					You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your esoteric theories, and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an
					arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describethis book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:
				</p><ul>
					<li>A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock</li>
					<li>A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope</li>
					<li>A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship</li>
					<li>A leather briefcase with two small golden locks</li>
					<li>A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides</li>
					<li>A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.</p>
				<h4>Spellcasting</h4>
				<p>
					Your arcane research has given you facility with spells. See "Combat &amp; Casting" for the general rules of spellcasting and "Spell Lists" for the apothecary spell list. Intelligence is your
					spellcasting abilily for apothecary spells. You can use an arcane focus (see the "Items" page) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.<br>
					<b>Spell Save DC:</b> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
					<b>Spell Attack Bonus:</b> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cantrips</b><br>
					You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the
					Apothecary table. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Preparing Spells</b><br>
					You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your
					Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your
					level. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
					<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spell Slots</b><br>
					The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots
					are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if you are a 5<sup>th</sup>-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd,
					or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
				</p>
				<h4>Esoteric Theories</h4>
				<p>
					At 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you gain two esoteric theories of your choice. Esoteric theories are scraps of forbidden lore that you can use to augment your magical abilities. When you gain certain
					apothecary levels, you gain additional theories of your choice, as shown in the Theories Known column of the Apothecary table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
					one of the theories you know and replace it with another theory that you could learn at that level. If a theory has a level requirement, you can learn that theory only if your apothecary
					levels meet that requirement.<br>
					<b><i>Your theory options are detailed at the bottom of this page.</i></b>
				</p>
				<h4>Greater Formula</h4>
				<p>
					At 11<sup>th</sup> level, you discover a magical secret called a Greater Formula. Choose one 6th-level spell from the apothecary spell list as this formula. You can cast your Greater Formula
					once without expending a spell slot. You regain all uses of your Greater Formulae when you finish a long rest. Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you
					can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level from the Apothecary spell list
				</p><p>
					At higher levels, you gain more apothecary spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one
					7th-level spell at 13<sup>th</sup> level, one 8th-level spell at 15<sup>th</sup> level, and one 9th-level spell at 17<sup>th</sup> level. You learn an additional 6th level spell at
					19<sup>th</sup> level, and an additional 7th level spell at 20<sup>th</sup> level.

				</p>
				<h4>Miraculous Recovery</h4>
				<p>
					At 20<sup>th</sup> level, you can spend 5 minutes channeling power into a number of creatures (which can include yourself) equal to your Intelligence modifier to facilitate an abnormally fast
					recovery. You must tend to the creatures during this period, using a healer's kit with at least one use remaining. The targets regain hit points, spell slots, hit dice, and other abilities as
					if they completed a long rest. A creature can only benefit from one Miraculous Recovery in a 24-hour period. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h2>Subclasses: Occult Practices</h2>
			<p>
				All apothecaries pursue a chosen discipline which defines their ongoing research of the body and spirit.
			</p>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Alienist -->
				<summary><h4>Alienist</h4></summary>
				<p>
					An Alienist seeks to master the mysteries of the mind. Having devoted years to studying the inner workings of the brain, and unlocking its latent potential, an Alienist is able to read and
					manipulate the thoughts of others, and bend reality itself. They tap into unfathomable realities and shift the world to their will using the psychic energies they call upon from eldritch lore
					and arcane knowledge.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>
				<p>
					You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alienist Spells table. These spells count as apothecary spells for you, but they don't
					count against the number of apothecary spells you prepare.

				<h4>Advanced Psychology</h4>
				<p>
					You learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=EldritchBlast"><i>Eldritch Blast</i></a> cantrip. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency
					with another skill of your choice.
				</p>
				<h4>Mental Influence</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you have studied hard to unlock the deepest recesses of your psyche, unleashing untapped psychic potential within yourself. This energy is represented by a
					pool of Psychic Points. You have four psychic points. You gain two more at 6<sup>th</sup> level, another two at 10<sup>th</sup>, and two more again at 14<sup>th</sup> level, which you can
					expend to use the various psionic powers you have detailed below. If you have expended all your Psychic Points, you cannot use these powers. You regain all your expended Psychic Points when
					you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<p><b><i>Cerebral Breakthrough:</i></b> When you cast an apothecary spell that deals damage, you can expend a Psychic Point to re-roll any number of the dice. You must use the new rolls.</p>
				<p><b><i>Mind Over Matter:</i></b> Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Psychic Point, reducing the damage taken by an amount equal to your apothecary level.</p>
				<p><b><i>Mind Whisperer:</i></b> When you cast an apothecary spell which does not deal damage, you may spend a psychic point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p>
				<h4>Metaphysical Tether</h4>
				<p>
					Also beginning at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, as an action, you can touch a willing creature to create a psychic link with it which lasts a number of hours equal to your Apothecary level or until you
					end the link (no action required). The maximum number of links you can have at any time is equal to your proficiency bonus. All the creatures tethered in this way can communicate telepathically
					with one another as long as they are within 100 feet of each other.
				</p>
				<h4>Force Manipulation</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, Your mental prowess allows you to control the very fabric of your own reality around you, allowing you to defy gravity and push yourself through the air using
					only your mind. As a bonus action, you can expend a psychic point to give yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute, during which you can hover.
				</p>
				<h4>Mental Magic</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, you gain new ways to use your latent psychic powers to manipulate the essence of your spells and spellcasting. You gain three new ways to use your Psychic Points:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Fight or Flight Response:</i></b> Once per turn when a target you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against a spell you cast, you
					can expend a Psychic Point to fill its mind with scrambled psionic energy, forcing it to reroll the d20 and use the lower roll for its saving throw, possibly turning a success into a failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Mentally Prepared:</i></b> Once per turn, when a target you can see within 30 feet of you, including yourself, fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can use a
					Psychic Point and add your Intelligence modifier to the creature's saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Prescribed Effects:</i></b> As a bonus action, you can expend a Psychic Point and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You immediately gain temporary hit points
					equal to twice your intelligence modifier.
				</p>
				<h4>Self-Diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, if you have no Psychic Points remaining, you can use an bonus action and expend a spell slot to regain 1d4 Psychic Points. You also gain two additional psychic
					features:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Careful Examination:</i></b> Whenever you cast a spell which restores hit points to a creature, you may expend a Psychic Point. If you do, all creatures targeted by the spell regain an
					additional amount of hit points equal to twice your Intelligence modifier.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Enhanced Cerebellum:</i></b> When you cast any spell of 1st level or higher from your Alienist Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number
					of psychic points equal to the spell's level.
				</p>
				<h4>Impenetrable Mind</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you are resistant to psychic damage and immune to being charmed or frightened. Magic cannot put you to sleep and you have advantage on saving throws against
					spells that attempt to read your thoughts or control your mind or actions, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=DominatePerson"><i>Dominate Person</i></a>. Additionally, when you use the
					Self-Diagnosis feature to regain Psychic Points using a spell slot, you now regain Psychic Points equal to the spell's level.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Chemist -->
				<summary><h4>Chemist</h4></summary>
				<p>
					A Chemist is a studied scientist whose advanced research in to chemical compounds has granted them the ability to terrorize their enemies with alchemical explosions, devastating gasses, and
					other horrific concoctions. Chemists love testing their new compounds in the field, and are always keen to advance their study and research further, finding new combinations to combust their
					foes with.
				</p>
				<h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>
				<p>
					You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Chemist Spells table. These spells count as apothecary spells for you, but they don't
					count against the number of apothecary spells you prepare.

				<h4>Chemical Compound</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies if you do not already have it. You also learn the <a href="./spells.html?l=FireBolt"><i>Fire Bolt</i></a> cantrip and one additional evocation
					cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. These cantrips count as apothecary cantrips for you, but do not count against your cantrips known.
				</p>
				<h4>Precise Application</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>rd</sup> level, when you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage to other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to
					your Intelligence modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
					save.
				</p>
				<h4>Chain Reaction</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast an apothecary cantrip that normally targets only one creature and deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, the spell can instead
					target two creatures that are within the spell's range.
				</p>
				<h4>Chemical Conditioning</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, as an action, you give one creature you touch (including yourself) resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage for 1 hour. This benefit ends
					immediately if you use this feature again.
				</p>
				<h4>Bottled Spells</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you can store a spell from your Chemist Spells feature as a liquid in a small vial or bottle you touch when you cast the spell. The spell has no effect other
					than to be stored in the bottle. The spell remains stored inside until a creature opens the bottle. Once you use this feature, any unused bottled spell you previously created becomes inert, and
					you can't bottle another spell until you finish a short rest. Any creature holding the bottle may spend an action to open it and cast the spell inside. The spell uses your spell attack bonus
					and save DC, but the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster in all other respects.
				</p>
				<h4>Elemental Adjustment</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell using an apothecary spell slot which deals a type of damage from the following list, you can change that damage type to one of the other
					listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
				</p>
				<h4>Chemical Cataclysm</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 18<sup>th</sup> level, When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lighting, or poison damage using an apothecary spell slot, it is treated as if it was cast using a
					7th-level spell slot.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details class="classdetails subclass"> <!-- Exorcist -->
				<summary><h4>Exorcist</h4></summary>
				<p>
					An Exorcist comes prepared to deal with evil entities, sinister spirits, and fearsome fiends. Equipped with their holy symbol, a book of prayers, and a bag of ritualistic baubles, they stand
					ready to face the most unnatural and otherworldly entities of the realms. An Exorcist is accustomed to facing down insurmountable threats, with a holy symbol in hand they fear nothing, and
					stand as a shield between the realms of men, and those of monsters.

				<h4>Spiritual Study</h4>
				<p>
					You gain proficiency in heavy armor and the Religion Skill. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with another skill of your choice. You can use a holy symbol as an arcane
					focus for your apothecary spells and you gain a cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list. This cantrip counts as an apothecary cantrip for you.
				</p>
				<h4>Exorcism</h4>
				<p>
					At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you gain the ability to imbue divine energy through your holy symbol to expel evil entities in the area, or purge their harmful effects from your allies. When you use
					this feature, you choose which effect to create. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
					a short or long rest. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If an Exorcism effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Apothecary spell save DC. Starting at 5th level, when an undead or fiend fails its saving throw against your Expel Evil
					feature, that creature takes 4d8 radiant damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Expel Evil:</i></b> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring creatures that mean you harm. Each undead, celestial, fey, or fiend that can see or hear you
					within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br> A turned creature must spend its turns
					trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try
					to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Purge Corruption:</i></b> You touch a creature or item and can end either one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.
					Additionally, if a creature is possessed or mind controlled by a spirit or other kind of foreign entity, you can use this feature to remove any traits or other features related to the
					possession. If possessed, the creature possessing it is shunted out of its host to an unoccupied space within 5 feet and takes psychic damage equal to 2d8 + your apothecary level.
				</p>
				<h4>Sacred Vessel</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you are immune to the frightened condition, and cannot be possessed or cursed. You also have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.
				</p>
				<h4>Negation</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 10<sup>th</sup> level, as a reaction when a hostile creature you can see targets an ally with an attack, spell, or other effect, you can expend an Apothecary spell slot to force it
					to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the action they were attempting fails and resources used are wasted.
				</p>
				<h4>Empowered Healing</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, whenever you cast a spell that heals a creature, that spell deals maximum healing and the creature immediately gains temporary hit points equal to you
					apothecary level.
				</p>
				<h4>Devout Witness</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 18<sup>th</sup> level, you speak on behalf of your gods and can feel their powers surging through you. Commanding spirits and vanquishing evil is second nature to you. You have

				<h4>Transmogrifying Elixir</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 3<sup>th</sup> level, as a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to undergo a grotesque transformation. The transformation ends after one minute, or if you are reduced to 0 hit
					points or incapacitated. When you undergo this transformation you maintain your personality, alignment, and game statistics. However, several changes occur:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your Strength and Intelligence ability scores are swapped.</li>
					<li>Your size becomes Large, your jump distance is doubled, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Your speed increases by 5 feet per level of spell slot used.</li>
					<li>Your AC is 13 + the level of spell slot used.</li>
					<li>At the start of each of your turns and as long as you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell slot used.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Potent Biology</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you are in your transmogrified form, you have more powerful attacks capable of bypassing your enemy's greatest defenses. While transmogrified, you can
					attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, and your big meaty fist attacks count as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks
					and damage. When you hit with an attack using your big meaty fists, you can expend a spell slot to empower the force of your blow with unnatural energy. When you expend a spell slot in this way
					you deal an additional 1d8 force damage per level of spell slot used.
				</p>
				<h4>Adaptive Genetics</h4>
				<p>
					Beginning at 10<sup>th</sup> level, you are able to use your changed biology to protect yourself from the clutches of death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points in either your natural, or
					transmogrified state, your other self is ready to take over.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When in your natural form and reduced to 0 hit points you can immediately transform using your Transmogrifying Elixir feature expending a spell slot as normal. You regain a number of hit
						points equal to your Apothecary level when you do (in addition to gaining temporary hit points from your transformation)</li>
					<li>When you are reduced to 0 hit points in your transmogrified form, you revert to your natural form with 1 hit point remaining. If you do, you can't assume your transmogrified form again
						until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Unnatural Evolution</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 14<sup>th</sup> level, You can use your Greater Formula feature to transmogrify as if you had used a spell slot of that level. When you transform in this way you gain one of the
					additional genome mutations listed below.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Draconic Genome:</i></b> You grow fleshy wings from your back and your skin takes on a scaly appearance. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and as an action can spew bile
					in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 8d6 acid damage, or half as much on a successful save. Once you use
					this feature, you can not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Giant Genome:</i></b> You become a hulking mass of flesh and muscle, turning yourself into a living siege weapon. Your size becomes Huge and all damage dealt to objects and structures is
					now doubled. As an action, you can expend a spell slot on your turn to slam your fists into the ground, sending shockwaves and rubble crashing around you. All creatures in a 30-foot radius
					centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or they take 8d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. If they succeed on the saving throw, they take
					half damage and are not knocked prone.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Cerebellum Genome:</i></b> You maintain a fraction of your mind as you transform, allowing remnants of your studies to linger in your monstrous brain. You now have the ability to maintain
					concentration on spells while in your transmogrified form. While transmogrified, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.
				</p>
				<h4>Adaptive Genetics</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, you have perfected your Transmogrifying Elixir, breaking the confines of evolution and pushing your form to what you deem the apex of evolution. You gain the following
					benefits while transmogrified.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As long as you have one or more hit points remaining, you can use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to regain hit points equal to ten times the level of the spell slot used.</li>
					<li>If you fail a saving throw, as a reaction you can expend a spell slot to succeed instead.</li>
					<li>Your Strength score becomes equal to your Intelligence score when transmogrified, instead of swapped with it. Additionally, you can cast spells while in your transmogrified form.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The study of diseases opens doorways to many dangerous scientific discoveries. As experts in both ridding the body of sickness and the mutations of infectious disease, Pathogenists bring their
					study to the battlefield by using monsters and enemies as test subjects for their infections. Long years spent carefully monitoring the causes and effects of such plagues allows them to be
					experts at disease mutation, allowing their sickness to spread in a terrifying manner and riddle their foes with debilitating symptoms, crippling their bodies and rattling their minds.

				<h4>Outbreak Infection</h4>

					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when you cast a spell using an apothecary spell slot or your Greater Formula feature that causes disease, that spell ignores any creature's immunity to disease.

					disease to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of that creature.

				<h4>Insidious Incubation</h4>

					At 3<sup>rd</sup> level, you construct a companion from scavenged body parts and brought it to life with your occult magic: a corpsewrought creature. The creature is friendly to you and your
					companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Corpsewrought Creature stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You can
					determine the cosmetic characteristics of the creature; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
				</p>
				<p>
					In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the
					Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the
					creature can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. If your corpsewrought creature has died within the last hour, you can use your healer's kit as an action to revive it, provided you
					are within 5 feet of it and you expend an apothecary spell slot. The corpsewrought companion returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. At the end of a long rest, you can
					create a new corpsewrought creature if you have your healer's kit with you and access to suitable “materials.” If you already have a corpsewrought creature from this feature, the first one
					immediately perishes. The creature also perishes if you die.

				<h4>Bodyguard</h4>
				<p>
					Starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, when a creature within 5 feet of your corpsewrought creature makes an attack against you, it can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the
					attacking creature. In addition, your corpsewrought creature's slam attack counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In
					addition, you can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=AnimateDead"><i>Animate Dead</i></a> once using an Apothecary spell slot. Once you do, you can't cast the spell again until you finish a long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Animated Head</h4>
				<p>
					Also starting at 6<sup>th</sup> level, you have reanimated the head of a dead humanoid creature which now serves you in your studies. You may use the head as a spellcasting focus. The head
					speaks common and one other language of your choice. Whenever you make an Intelligence ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
					Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana and Investigation skills.<br>
					You can use the head to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=SpeakWithDead"><i>Speak With Dead</i></a> without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature you can't do so again until you finish
					a short or long rest.
				</p>
				<h4>Behold, My Creation</h4>
				<p>
					At 10<sup>th</sup> level, your corpsewrought creature's size increases to Large, and its speed increases to 40 feet. When your corpsewrought creature hits a creature with a melee attack, it can
					immediately attempt to <a href="./combat.html?f=Grappled">grapple</a> the target. The DC to escape this grapple is equal to 8 + the corpsewrought creature's strength modifier (+4) + your PB.

					Beginning at 14<sup>th</sup> level, When you command your corpsewrought creature to take the Attack action, the creature can make two attacks.

				<h4>I Can't Stop the Monster I Created</h4>
				<p>
					At 18<sup>th</sup> level, Your corpsewrought creature increases in size to Huge, gains a reach of 10 feet, and its speed increases to 50 feet. Its slam attack deals an additional 1d8 bludgeoning
