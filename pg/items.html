			<h1>Financial information for Wall of Force Street bankers</h1>
			<p>
				Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in
				goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobilily trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars,
				measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.

			<h2>Coins</h2>
			<p>
				Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp),
				and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold
				piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold
				pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or
				valuable goods.

			<p>
				One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver
				piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious
				metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism
				when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a
				pound.
			</p>
			<h2>Trade Goods</h2>
			<p>
				Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest). Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade.
				Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services
				that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly
				exchanged goods.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sellingitems">Selling Goods</h2>
			<p class="listspacer">
				Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other
				settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b>Trade Goods:</b><br> Trade goods are as much currency as they are items, and can normally be exhanged for other things at their full market value as though they were coins.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b>Arms, Armor, and other Equipment:</b><br> As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are
				rarely in good enough condition to sell.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects:</b><br> These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For
				exceptionally valuable treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b>Magic Items:</b><br> Selling Magic items is more often that not a complicated process. The suggestions and rules for doing so are detailed under the Magic Items tab.

			<h2 id="livingexpenses">Lifestyle Expenses</h2>
			<p>
				Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore,
				expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls. At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and
				pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your
				lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Mainlaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living
				frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

				The expenses and lifeslyles assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople
				to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and
				repairing their own gear. Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. Spending time on foraging as though performing a downtime activity lets
				you eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Wretched</span><br>
				You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than
				you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which
				represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Squalid</span><br>
				You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate
				and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle
				level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Poor</span><br>
				A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though
				probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend
				with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Modest</span><br>
				A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't
				go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and
				the like.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Comfortable</span><br>
				Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room
				at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Wealthy</span><br>
				Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle
				comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good
				part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Aristocratic</span><br>
				You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or
				rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social
				gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and
				treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

				Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or
				art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills. Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of
				people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature
				replica) for use in the <a href="./spells.html?l=SecretChest"><i>Secret Chest</i></a> spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance
				in front of the duke
			</p>
			<p>
				Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric
				lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind (see the Property & Business tab), they might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or
				steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.
				Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some
				expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.
			</p>
			<h4>Spellcasting Services</h4>
			<p>
				People who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely
				easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs. Hiring someone to cast a
				relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a>, is easy enough in a city
				or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large
				city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as
				retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.

			<h2 id="armors">Armor</h2>
			<p>
				D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather
				armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into
				three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield. The armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of
				armor worn in the worlds of D&D. Explanations are given below it.

				<b class="noindent">Armor Proficiency:</b> Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you
				proficiency with certain types of armor, as do some feats. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves
				Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

				<b class="noindent">Heavy Armor:</b> Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the armor table shows "STR 13" or "STR 15" in the Strength column for an armor

			<h4>Getting In and Out of Armor</h4>
			<p>
				Putting on or taking off armor is not an easy process the way it is with clothes. The time it takes to don or doff (put on or take off) armor depends on the armor's category. You benefit from the
				armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor. If you have help, you can doff armor in half the time stated by the table. You don or doff a shield as an action.
			</p>
			<h4>Equipment Sizes</h4>
			<p>
				In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling's leather armor, and a
				gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant's elegant robe.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly
				ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise. Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an
				armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4x10 or
				determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.
			</p>
			<h4>Light Armor</h4>
			<p class="listspacer">
				Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Padded</span><br>
				Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Leather</span><br>
				The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Studded Leather</span><br>
				Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.
			</p>
			<h4>Medium Armor</h4>
			<p class="listspacer">
				Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Hide</span><br>
				This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. lt is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Chain Shirt</span><br>
				Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings
				rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Scale Mail</span><br>
				This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Breastplate</span><br>
				This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather, Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital
				organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered,
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Half Plate</span><br>
				Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body, It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.
			</p>
			<h4>Heavy Armor</h4>
			<p class="listspacer">
				Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage
				their weight and bulk.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Ring Mail</span><br>
				This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by
				those who can't afford better armor.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Chain Mail</span><br>
				Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Splint</span><br>
				This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span style="font-weight:bold;" class="noindent">Plate</span><br>
				Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, sabatons over heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding
				underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.
			</p>
			<h2 id="weaponslist">Weapons</h2>
			<p>
				Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability
				to wield it effeclively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, the
				damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <b>melee weapon</b> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you,
				whereas a <b>ranged weapon</b> is used to attack a target at a distance.
			</p>
			<p title="Also I know the DMG lists them as martial weapons but the gun is the great equalizer for a reason. Both shortbows and slings are MUCH harder to use than a pistol or rifle.">
				<i>*These weapons are beyond the technology of most D&D worlds, but present on many. Ask your DM if they're present!</i>

			<h4>Weapon Proficiency</h4>
			<p>
				Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. Martial weapons require more specialized
				training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency
				bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
			</p>
			<h4 id="WeaponProperties">Weapon Properties</h4>
			<p class="listspacer">Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the weapons table above.</p>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Ammunition</b></summary>
				You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of
				ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search
				the battlefield—unless your weapon is a firearm, the ammunition of which is destroyed upon use.<br>
				If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see below). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Finesse</b></summary>
				When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Heavy</b></summary>
				Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it to a large for a Small creature to use effectively.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Light</b></summary>
				A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. <a href="./combat.html?l=meleeatks">See the rules for two-weapon fighting on the Combat & Casting page</a>.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Loading</b></summary>
				Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks
				you can normally make.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Range</b></summary>
				A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in
				feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's
				maximum range.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Reach</b></summary>
				This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. Creatures provoke opportunity attacks when entering the reach of a creature wielding a weapon with this property.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Special Weapon: Lance</b></summary>
				You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation" id="SpecialWeaponNet">
				<summary><b>Special Weapon: Net</b></summary>
				A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a> until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to
				make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the
				effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Thrown</b></summary>
				If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that
				you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the
				dagger has the finesse property.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation" title="i literally cannot believe this this is so surprising">
				<summary><b>Two-handed</b></summary>
				This weapon requires two hands to use.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary><b>Versatile</b></summary>
				This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
			</details>
			<h4>Adamantine and Silvered Weapons</h4>
			<p>
				Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft <a href="./items.html?l=AdamantineArmor"><i class="uncmmagit">Adamantine
				Armor</i></a>, the metal is also used for weapons. Melee weapons and ammunition made of adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon or piece of
				ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit. The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a
				single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less
				effective.
			</p>
			<h4>Improvised Weapons</h4>
			<p>
				Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon indudes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a
				table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club.
				At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use their proficiency bonus. 
			</p>
			<p>
				An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a
				melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

				A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with
				certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool
				represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of
				particularly hard wood.
			</p>
			<h2>Tool Use and Proficiency In-Game</h2>
			<p class="listspacer">
				Tool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a character's background and talents. In-game, though, the use of tools in adventure settings migth not be obvious, and sometimes overlaps with the
				use of skills. This section aims to remedy that, both by explaining how you might use a tool proficiency both by itself, as well as <i>together</i> with a skill, and how the tool itself functions
				when used.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer noindent">The section below eplains the tools listed on the table using the following sections:</p>
			
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b class="noindent">Components:</b><br>
				The second paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b class="noindent">Skills:</b><br>
				Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. You make a check using the
				indicated skill with advantage. In addition, you might also gain extra information or an added benefit on a skill check, as determined by the DM. The text provides some examples and ideas when this
				opportunity is relevant.<br>
				Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.
				With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about
				facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b class="noindent">Special Use:</b><br>
				Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph.
			</p>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<b class="noindent">Sample DCs:</b><br>
				A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.

				<summary>Calligrapher's Supplies</summary>
				<p>
					Calligraphy treats writing as a delicate, beautiful art. Calligraphers produce text that is pleasing to the eye, using a style that is difficult to forge. Their supplies also give them some
					ability to examine scripts and determine if they are legitimate, since a calligrapher's training involves long hours of studying writing and attempting to replicate its style and design.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Components:</b><br>
					Calligrapher's supplies include ink, a dozen sheets of parchment, and three quills.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Skill: Arcana</b><br>
					Although calligraphy is of little help in deciphering the content of magical writings, proficiency with these supplies can aid in identifying who wrote a script of a magical nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Skill: History</b><br>
					This tool proficiency can augment the benefit of successful checks made to analyze or investigate ancient writings, scrolls, or other texts, including runes etched in stone or messages in
					frescoes or other displays.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Dechipher Treasure Map:</b><br>

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Temporary Shelter:</b><br>
					As part of a long rest, you can construct a lean-to or a similar shelter to keep your group dry and in the shade for the duration of the rest. Because it was fashioned quickly from whatever wood

			<h2 id="poisondesc" title="akshully its toxins reeeee">Poison</h2>
			<p class="listspacer">
				<span class="noindent">G</span>iven their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures. Poisons each
				have their own debilitating effects, and they come in the following four types, based on the method of delivery:
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span class="noindent" style="font-weight:bold;">Contact</span><br>
				A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span class="noindent" style="font-weight:bold;">Ingested</span><br>
				A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing
				only half damage on a failed save.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span class="noindent" style="font-weight:bold;">Inhaled</span><br>
				These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when they are inhaled. A single dose fills a 5-foot cube.
			</p>
			<p class="invocation">
				<span class="noindent" style="font-weight:bold;">Injury</span><br>
				A creature that takes slashing or piercing damage from a weapon or piece of ammunition coated with injury poison is exposed to its effects. A single dose of Injury-type poison is enough to cover one
				slashing or piercing weapon, or three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action, and once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute before drying.

			<h4>Obtaining Poison</h4>
			<p>
				In some settings, strict laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but a black-market dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be
				able to acquire poison relatively easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they track down the poison they seek. The table gives suggested prices for
				single doses of various poisons.
			</p>
			<p>
				During downtime between adventures, you can use the rules for crafting an item to create basic poison if you have proficiency with a poisoner's kit. Crafting other poisons might be more complicated.
				Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure. You can also attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous or
				venomous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC20 Intelligence (Nature) check.
				(Proficiency with the poisoner's kit grants advantage on this check.) On a successful check, you harvest enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, you are unable to extract any poison. If
				you fail the check by 5 or more, you are subjected to the creature's poison.
			</p>

				When you make your character, you can roll once on the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table. It can help stock a room in a
				dungeon or fill a creature's pockets.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">I</span>f you're creating a character for a horror or gothic-themed campaign, consider rolling on the Horror Trinkets table instead. Similarly, if your the character is meant
				to be from or adventure in an arctic environment, consider the Polar Trinkets table.

			<h1 id="mahoumono">The ins and outs of Magic Items</h1>
			<p>
				Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of conquered monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their
				owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most magic items are objects of extraordinary artisanship. Thanks to a combination of careful crafting and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical item of its kind.
				Most magic items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance to all damage. Artifacts, detailed at the bottom of this page, are practically indestructible, requiring extraordinary measures to
				destroy.

				Each magic item has a rarity: <span class="comnmagit">Common</span>, <span class="uncmmagit">Uncommon</span>, <span class="raremagit">Rare</span>, <span class="vryrmagit">Very Rare</span>, or
				<span class="lgndmagit">Legendary</span>. Common magic items, such as a <a href="?f=PotionofHealing"><i class="comnmagit">Potion of Healing</i></a>, are the most plentiful. These items seldom
				increase a character's power, but they are likely to amuse players and provide fun roleplaying opportunities. Some legendary items, such as the
				<a href="?f=ApparatusofKwalish"><i class=lgndmagit>Apparatus of Kwalish</i></a>, are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then
				gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can't be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table. A character doesn't typically
				find a rare magic item, for example, until around 5th level.
			</p>
			<h2>Categories</h2>
			<p>
				Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.
			</p>
			<h4>Armor</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/armor.png"> <span class="noindent">U</span>nless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.
				Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, its abilities can be applied to any type.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Clothing</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/clothing.png"> <span class="noindent">C</span>lothing includes articles such as boots, capes, hats, robes, and more. Unless its

			<h4>Jewelry</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/jewelry.png"> <span class="noindent">M</span>agic pieces of jewelry, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets, and rings offer an amazing

			<h4>Magic Tattoos</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/tattoos.png"> <span class="noindent">B</span>lending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with
				wondrous abilities. They are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature. Once inscribed on a creature's body, damage or injury doesn't impair the tattoo's function,
				even if the tattoo is defaced. When applying a magic tattoo, a creature can customize the tattoo's appearance. A magic tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a birthmark, patterns of scale, or
				any other cosmetic alteration.<br>
				The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it typically occupies on a creature's skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a given tattoo is.
			</p>
			<h4>Weapons</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/weapons.png"> <span class="noindent">W</span>hether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry,
				magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers. Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn't specify its
				weapon type, its abilities can be applied to any type.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Staffs</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/staffs.png"> <span class="noindent">A</span> magic staff is about 5 or 6 feet long. Staffs vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly
				equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. Depending on the material, a staff weighs between 2
				and 7 pounds. Unless a staff's description says otherwise, a staff can be used as a quarterstaff.
			</p>
			<h4>Wands</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/wands.png"> <br>A magic wand is about 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal,
				crystal, stone, or some other material.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Instruments</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/bard.png"> <br>A magic instrument is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Rods</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/rods.png"> <br>A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone.
				It's about 2 or 3 feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>Potions</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/potions.png"> <span class="noindent">D</span>ifferent kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from
				enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid.<br>Potions are consumable magic items.
				Drinking a potion or administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately,
				and it is used up.
			</p>
			<h4>Scrolls</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/scrolls.png"> <span class="noindent">M</span>ost scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that
				produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.<br>
				A scroll is a consumable magic item. Whatever the nature of the magic contained in a scroll, unleashing that magic requires using an action to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the
				scroll can't be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust. Any creature that can understand a written language can read the arcane script on a scroll <span style="margin-left:69px;">a</span>nd attempt to activate it.
			</p>
			<h4>Wondrous Items</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="categoryfirst" src="../Stylefiles/classicons/wondrousitems.png"> <br>Wondrous items include items such as bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns,
				and more. This category is catch-all for that which doesn't fit any of the previous categories.<br><br>

			<h2>Identifying a Magic Item</h2>
			<div class="notes" style="float:right; width:27%; position:relative; top:-10px;">
				<h4 style="font-size:110%;"><i>Variant: More Difficult Identification</i></h4>
				<p>
					If the DM prefers magic items to have a greater mystique, they might remove the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a> spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item's appearance, handling the item
				is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item's properties isn't automatic, however. The <a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a>
				spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the
				rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a
				<a href="?f=RingofFeatherFalling"><i class="raremagit">Ring of Feather Falling</i></a>. Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if your
				character puts on a <a href="?f=RingofJumping"><i class=uncmmagit>Ring of Jumping</i></a>, your DM might say, "Your steps feel strangely springy." Perhaps your character then jumps up and down to
				see what happens. Your DM then says you jump unexpectedly high.
			</p>
			<h2 id="attunement">Attunement</h2>
			<p>
				Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the
				prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits,
				unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical
				properties.
			</p>
			<p>
				Attuning to an item requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical coritact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties).
				This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails.
				Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words. An item can be attuned to
				only one creature at a time, and you can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your attunement to an item first.
				Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one <a href="?f=RingofProtection"><i class="raremagit">Ring of Protection</i></a> at a
				time. Your attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another
				creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed or symbiotic (see below).
			</p>
			<h4>Attuning to a Magic Tattoo</h4>
			<p>
				To attune to a tattoo, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle
				turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.
			</p>
			<h4>Symbiotic items</h4>
			<p>
				A select few items are symbiotic. Attuning to such an item reflects physically bonding with it. While these objects aren't evil, some people might be disturbed upon seeing your living armor or
				tentacle whip! You can't willingly end your attunement to a symbiotic magic item, but the attunement ends if you are subjected to an effect that ends a curse. In such a caste, the item falls off or
				exits your body as appropriate
			</p>
			<h2>Wearing and Wielding Magic Items</h2>
			<p>
				Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on
				the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand. In most cases, a magic item that's
				meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist, and
				your DM might rule that an item doesn't adjust, usually for story or lore reasons. For example, dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped characters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a
				<a href="?f=BootsofSpringingandStriding"><i class="uncmmagit">Boot of Striding and Springing</i></a> on one foot and a <a href="?f=BootsofElvenkind"><i class="uncmmagit">Boot of Elvenkind</i></a> on
				the other foot gains no benefit from either item.
			</p>
			<p>
				Common sense normally dictates whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one
				pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. However, there can be exceptions at the DM's discretion; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for
				example, or be able to layer two cloaks.
			</p>
			<h2 id="activation">Activating Magic Items</h2>
			<p>
				Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item
				is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules for their activation. If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature
				such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.
			</p>
			<h4>Command Word</h4>
			<p>
				A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the
				<a href="./spells.html?l=Silence"><i>Silence</i></a> spell.
			</p>
			<h4>Consumables</h4>
			<p>
				Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item
				loses its magic.
			</p>
			<h4>Spells</h4>
			<p>
				Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no
				components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration.
				Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time,
				duration, or other parts of a spell. A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one
				spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier
				is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus applies.
			</p>
			<h4>Charges</h4>
			<p>
				Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an <a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a>
				spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.
			</p>
			<h2>Cursed Items</h2>
			<p>
				Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item, A magic item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of
				identifying items, including the <a href="./spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a> spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's
				user when the curse's effects are revealed. Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the
				<a href="./spells.html?l=RemoveCurse"><i>Remove Curse</i> spell.
			</p>
			<h2 id="buymagit">Buying Magic Items</h2>
			<p>
				Most magic items are so rare that they aren't readily available for purchase. Common items, such as a <a href="?f=PotionofHealing"><i class="comnmagit">Potion of Healing</i></a>, can usually be procured from alchemists, herbalists, or
				spellcasters. However, doing so is rarely as simple as walking into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller might ask for a service, rather than coin.
				In a large city with an academy of magic or a major temple, buying and selling rarer magic items might be possible, but it's likely to be similar to the market for fine art in the real world, with
				invitation-only auctions and a tendency to attract thieves.

				beyond, Artificers might also craft items for use by military forces or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. Sale of magic items is often highly regulated, accompanied by a thriving
				black market. 
			</p>
			<h4>The Process of Buying a Magic Item</h4>
			<p>
				Purchasing a magic item is normally a downtime activity as described below. It requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller
				will have the items a character desires.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finding magic items to purchase requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item. A character
				seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine the quality of the seller found. The Character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is
				spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress
				potential business partners.<br>
				Furthermore, to reflect the availability of items in the campaign, the DM can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns, or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. They can also double magic item
				costs in low magic campaigns.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're after a specific magic item, first ask the DM if it's an item they're willing to allow it in the game. If they are, you find the desired item for sale on a check total of 10 or higher if
				the item is <span class="comnmagit">common</span>, 15 or higher if it is <span class="uncmmagit">uncommon</span>, 20 or higher if it is <span class="raremagit">rare</span>, 25 or higher if it is
				<span class="vryrmagit">very rare</span>, and 30 or higher if it is <span class="lgndmagit">legendary</span>.

				As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Random Magic Items Appendix to roll on to determine which items are on the market. The check dictates the
				last table you're allowed to roll on, and you can roll on a table corresponding to a lower check if you prefer. Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based
				on their rarity, <b>halving the resulting price for any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll</b>. The DM always has final say on what items are available and how much they cost, no matter
				what any tables or rolls say.<br>
				<i>NOTE: The tables in question are from the Dungeon Master's Guide and thus don't include any magic items invented after that book's release. There is no good solution to this, so just be advised!</i>

			<h4>Complications</h4>
			<p>
				The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. The DM might roll on the Purchase
				Complications Table or invent some other complication you run into when puchasing an item.<br>
				*Might involve a rival <span title="or xanathar's for as long as that isn't finished">(see the DM tips)</span>
			</p>
			<h2 id="sellmagit">Selling a Magic Item</h2>
			<p>
				Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their profession. A character who comes into
				possession of a <span class="comnmagit">common</span>, <span class="uncmmagit">uncommon</span>, <span class="raremagit">rare</span>, or <span class="vryrmagit">very rare</span> magic item that they
				want to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic
				items. <span class="lgndmagit">Legendary</span> magic items and priceless <span class="artimagit">artifacts</span> can't be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the
				substance of an adventure or quest.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. You must pick one item at a time to sell. To find a buyer, make a
				Charisma (Persuasion) check, modified by the item's rarity, to determine what kind of offer comes in. You can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again
				later. Use the Salable Magic Items and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price. <b>The price is halved for consumable items such as potions and scrolls.</b>

			<h4>Complications</h4>
			<p>
				The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their
				own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Sale
				Complications table.<br>

			<p>
				To start with, you need a formula for a magic item in order to create it. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, the formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to
				make the item. In most settings, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows you to create. For example, the formula for a <span class="comnmagit">common</span> magic item is
				<span class="uncmmagit">uncommon</span>, and no formulas exist for <span class="lgndmagit">legendary</span> items. In a setting where the creation of magic items is much more prevalent a formula has
				a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. You also need whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the
				Arcana skill.
			</p>
			<p>
				An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. The Magic
				Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature needed to be faced to acquire the materials for an item. In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a
				gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time you need to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item
				Crafting table. <b>Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.</b> As with nonmagical items, eligible creatures can collaborate on the crafting process to speed it up. (See
				the Downtime tab on the Other Rules page)

			<p>
				<b>For the DM:</b> Finding special materials should take place as part of an adventure. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse.
				Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to. If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For
				example, creating <a href="?f=MarinersArmor"><i class="uncmmagit">Mariner's Armor</i></a> might require the essence of a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=WaterWeird"><b>water weird</b></a>. Crafting a
				<a href="?f=StaffofCharming"><i class="raremagit">Staff of Charming</i></a> might require the cooperation of a specific <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Arcanaloth"><b>arcanaloth</b></a>, who will
				help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a <a href="?f=StaffofPower"><i class="vryrmagit">Staff of Power</i></a> might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once
				touched by the god of magic—a stone now guarded by a suspicious <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Androsphinx"><b>androsphinx</b></a>. You can also decide that certain items also require special
				locations to be created. For example, the formula for a <a href="?f=FlameTongue"><i class="raremagit">Flame Tongue</i></a> might require that the weapon be forged with lava.
			</p>
			<h4>Complications</h4>
			<p>
				Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The
				complications you might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when you are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting
				an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.<br>

				doesn't require a formula, and takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character
				must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the Spell prepared, or it must be among
				the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.
			</p>
			<p>
				Crafting a <a href="?s=Spell Scroll"><i><span class="comnmagit">Spe</span><span class="uncmmagit">ll</span> <span class="raremagit">Sc</span><span class="vryrmagit">ro</span><span class="lgndmagit">ll</span></i></a>
				is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. However, it does come with its own set of complications. The complications that do arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for
				the activity. Every workweek spent scribing brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Scribing Complications table.<br>

					<h4>Variant: Wands That Don't Recharge</h4>
					<p>
						A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges
						in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they're expended.

					<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix: Custom Magic Items</h4>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main weapon, you could change a <a href="?f=HolyAvenger"><i class="lgndmagit">Holy Avenger</i></a>
					so that it's a flail instead of a sword. You can turn a <a href="?f=RingoftheRam"><i class="raremagit">Ring of the Ram</i></a> into a wand, or a
					<a href="?f=CloakofProtection"><i class="uncmmagit">Cloak of Protection</i></a> into a <i class="uncmmagit">Circlet of Protection</i>, all without altering the item's properties. Other
					substitutions are equally easy. An item that deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of another type. A <a href="?f=FlameTongue"><i class="raremagit">Flame Tongue</i></a> sword could
					deal lightning damage instead of fire, for example. One capability can replace another, so a <a href="?f=PotionofClimbing"><i class="comnmagit">Potion of Climbing</i></a> can easily become a
					<i class="comnmagit">Potion of Stealth</i>. You can also modify an item by fusing it with properties from another item. For example, you could combine the effects of a
					<a href="?f=HelmofComprehendingLanguages"><i class="uncmmagit">Helm of Comprehending Languages</i></a> with those of a <a href="?f=HelmofTelepathy"><i class="uncmmagit">Helm of Telepathy</i></a>
					into a single helmet. This makes the item more powerful (and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break your game. Finally, remember that giving an item an interesting minor property, a
					quirk, or sentience, as described in the next two appendicies, can alter its flavor significantly.
				</p>
				<p>
				<br><b>Creating a New Item</b><br>
					If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a character do something they couldn't do before, or improve the character's
					ability to do something they can do already. For example, the <a href="?f=RingofJumping"><i class="uncmmagit">Ring of Jumping</i></a> lets its wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what
					a character can already do. A <a href="?f=RingoftheRam"><i class="raremagit">Ring of the Ram</i></a>, however, gives a character the ability to deal force damage. The simpler your approach. the
					easier it is for a character to use the item in play. Giving the item charges is fine, especially if it has several different abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always active or can
					be used a fixed number of times per day is easier to manage.<br><br>

				<p>
					<b class="noindent">Power Level</b><br>
					An item that lets a character kill whatever they hit with it will likely unbalance the game and thus not allowed by the DM. Use the Power by Rarity table as a guide to help you
					determine how powerful an item should be, based on its rarity.<br>
					The Maximum Spell Level column of the table indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited property. For example, a common
					item might confer the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell
					more frequently.<br>
					If an item delivers a static bonus to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, the Maximum Bonus column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the item's rarity.
				</p>
				<p>
				<br><b>Creating Additional Common Items</b><br>
					The Optional Special Features appendix is useful if you want to design a common magic item. For example, the What Minor Property Does It Have? table might inspire you to create a magic item that
					allows a character to speak and understand the Goblin language (based on the table's Language property), a magic item that glows in the presence of fiends (based on the Sentinel property), or a
					magic item that projects its user's voice over a great distance (based on the War Leader property).

					<h4 style="display:inline-block;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix: Optional Special Features</h4>
				</summary>
				<p>
					You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What
					minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Answering these questions can help turn a generic magic item, such as a
					<a href="?f=Weapon1"><i class="uncmmagit">Longsword +1</i></a>, into a more flavorful discovery.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tables that follow can help you come up with answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. Some of the table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. Some magic
					items are made only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a <a href="?f=CloakofElvenkind"><i class="uncmmagit">Cloak of Elvenkind</i></a> is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If you
					roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up your own.

					Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case,
					the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.<br>
					Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the
					DM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those
					properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.

					<b class="noindent">Special Purpose</b><br>
					You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains
					cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special
					purpose or roll on the special purpose table to the right.
				</p>
				<h4>Conflict</h4>
				<p>
					A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a
					conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.</li>
					<li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</li>
					<li>The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.</li>
					<li>The item demands to be given to someone else.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><br>If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes the item can do any or all of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li>
					<li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li>
					<li>Attempt to take control of its wielder.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is
					charmed by item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
					Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

						Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color. While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that
						color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you
						would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

						This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
						Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position,
						able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.
					</p>
					<p>
						The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:<br>
						<b>Armor Class:</b> 20<br>
						<b>Hit Points:</b> 200<br>
						<b>Speed:</b> 30ft, swim 30ft (or 0ft for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)<br>
						<b>Damage Immunities:</b> Poison, Psychic<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.
					</p>
					<p>
						To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of
						breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a
						lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.

						Crafted from a thick, red fabric, this banner measures 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The krig (war) rune is displayed on the fabric with round, metal plates sewn into it. It can be attached
						to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Mark of Courage:</b><br>
						As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the frightened condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit
						lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sentinel Standard:</b><br>
						You can see invisible creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Standard's Shield:</b><br>
						As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of
						the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Gift of Battle:</b><br>
						You can transfer the banner's magic to a place by tracing the krig rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has
						a 500-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the banner to be within 5 feet of you and during which you choose creatures, creature
						types, or both that will benefit from the magic. At the end, the banner is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>While in the 500-foot-radius sphere, the creatures you chose during the transfer process are immune to the frightened condition and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and AC.</li>

						The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it,

					<p>
						<b><i>Personality:</i></b> <i class="lgndmagit">Blackrazor</i> speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and
						will one day return to it. <i class="lgndmagit">Blackrazor</i> is meant to hurry that process along.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite its nihilism, <i class="lgndmagit">Blackrazor</i> feels a strange kinship to <a href="?f=Wave"><i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i></a> and
						<a href="?f=Whelm"><i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i></a>, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat,
						even though it violently disagrees with <a href="?f=Whelm"><i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i></a> and finds <a href="?f=Wave"><i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i></a> tedious.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i class="lgndmagit">Blackrazor's</i> hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at
						the next sunset.

						This item is an ordinary, albeit rather large, conch shell that has been inscribed with the uvar rune. The conch measures 2&#189; feet long and weighs 20 pounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an action, you can cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Teleport"><i>Teleport</i></a> spell by blowing into the shell. The destination is fixed, and there is no chance of either a mishap or
						the spell being off target. Anyone teleported by the conch appears in a specific location designated by the item's creator at the time the uvar rune is inscribed on the conch. It doesn't
						allow teleportation to any other destination. Once its spell is cast, the conch can't be used again until the next dawn.

						Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as
						illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.
					</p>
					<p>
						The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

						Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in
						excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you
						fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card then reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

						<summary style="margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:-2em;"><i>A note for the DM on enmity (click me)</i></summary>
						<p style="padding-top:0px;">
							Two of the cards in a Deck of Many Things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's
							malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before
							being able to confront the devil itself.<br>In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you
							should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.
						</p>
					</details>
					<p>
						<b>Balance:</b> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned,
						this card has no effect on you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Comet:</b> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no
						effect.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Donjon:</b> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you
						occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a
						<a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Euryale:</b> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The Fates:</b> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at
						any other time before you die.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Flames:</b> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you
						or the devil dies.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Fool:</b> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level,
						you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Gem:</b> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Idiot:</b> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4+1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Jester:</b> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Key:</b> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Knight:</b> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death,
						believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Moon:</b> You are granted the ability to cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell 1d3 times.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Rouge:</b> A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a
						<a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Ruin:</b> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that
						alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Skull:</b> You summon an <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=AvatarofDeath"><b>Avatar of Death</b></a>—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in
						a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon
						it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Star:</b> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Sun:</b> You gain 50,000 XP, and a magic item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Talons:</b> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Throne:</b> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep
						somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Vizier:</b> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information,
						the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>The Void:</b> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place.
						While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is <a href="./combat.html?f=Incapacitated">incapacitated</a>. A <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell can't restore your
						soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

						You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the

						This wooden gavel is small by giant reckoning but nearly the size of a warhammer in human hands. The venn (friend) rune is inscribed in mithral in the base of the haft. Among giants, this

						As an action, you can use the gavel to strike a point on a hard surface. The first time in the next minute that a creature within 60 feet of that point deals damage to another creature with
						an attack that hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt to the target. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

						Made from the branch of a <a href="../dg/monsterlore.html?f=blights"><b>Gulthias tree</b></a>, a <i class="raremagit">Gulthias Staff</i> is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes
						beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All

						<b>Vampiric Strike:</b><br>
						The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt
						by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with
						<a href="./adventure.html?l=insane">short-term madness</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Blight Bane:</b><br>
						While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.

						This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm
						loses its magic. You gain the following benefits while wearing it:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component:
							<a href="./spells.html?l=Daylight"><i>Daylight</i></a> (opal), <a href="./spells.html?l=Fireball"><i>Fireball</i></a> (fire opal),
							<a href="./spells.html?l=PrismaticSpray"><i>Prismatic Spray</i></a> (diamond), or <a href="./spells.html?l=WallofFire"><i>Wall of Fire</i></a> (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell
							is cast and disappears from the helm.</li>
						<li>As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6
							radiant damage.</li>
						<li>As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</li>
						<li>As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a
							10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6
							fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each
						creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The
						helm and its gems are then destroyed.

						This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action
						to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature
						can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.

						An <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i> is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most
						of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Boxes</i> are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between
						devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i> weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.
					</p>
					<p>
						When an object small enough to fit inside an <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i> is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box
						open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i> is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle
						is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i>, that creature can open
						the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.
					</p>
					<p>
						A creature that spends 1 hour holding an <i class=uncmmagit>Infernal Puzzle Box</i> while trying to open it can make a DC30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the
						creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 12d6 psychic damage on
						a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

						wearer dies or the tack is removed.
					<p>
						You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with <i class="lgndmagit">Infernal Tack</i> by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the
						start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an
						action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form
						strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.

						This appears to be a simple ingot of iron ore, about a foot long and a few inches across. Inspection of its surface reveals the faint, silvery outline of the skold (shield) rune. The ingot
						has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Runic Shield:</b><br>
						You have a +1 bonus to AC.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Shield Bond:</b><br>
						As a bonus action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, other than yourself. Until the end of your next turn, any damage the target takes is reduced to 1, but you take
						half the damage prevented in this way. The damage you take can't be reduced in any way. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Shield Ward:</b><br>
						You can transfer the ingot's magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a two-handed melee weapon—by tracing the skold rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that
						requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the ingot is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Shield:</b> The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. Its magic gives you a +1 bonus to AC, and the first time after each of your long rests that damage reduces
							you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. You must be wielding the shield to gain these benefits.</li>
						<li><b>Weapon:</b> The weapon is now an uncommon magic weapon. It grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you're holding it.</li>

						You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the
						command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running
						along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command,
						which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the <a href="./spells.html?l=Knock"><i>Knock</i></a> spell and similar magic, such as that of a
						<a href="?f=ChimeofOpening"><i class="raremagit">Chime of Opening</i></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
						In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed
						automatically.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons
						excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating
						a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

						to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting <a href="./spells.html?l=DispelMagic"><i>Dispel Magic</i></a> on the message erases it. Otherwise,

						This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of
						stored spells chosen by the DM. Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in
						the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

						When you use an action to toss this stone into the air, it orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head. While
						this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is
						otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another creature can use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics)
						check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect. The stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage.

						This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane
						of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has
						advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to
						breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.
					<p>
						You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for
						that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature
						acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
					</p>
					<p>
						An <i>Identify</i> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain
						a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.

						Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions.
						The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or
						weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical
						object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total
						area of objects you create.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close
						inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material. If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you
						complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

						When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning

					</p>
					<p>
						If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action
						to speak the command word again. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be
						trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's
						nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.
					</p>
					<p>
						An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink,
						or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

						If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature
						appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
					</p>
					<p>
						While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named
						cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied

						Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the
						blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the
						elven gods.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability
						checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the
						weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6+1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
						this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moonblade
						Properties table.

						<b><i>Sentient:</i></b> A <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> is a sentient Good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision

					<p>
						The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more

					<p>
						If a <i class="lgndmagit">Moonblade</i> has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of

						This orb of granite is about the size of an adult human's fist. The stein (stone) rune appears on it in the form of crystalline veins that run across the surface. The orb has the following
						properties, which work only while it's on your person.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Indomitable Stand:</b><br>
						As an action, you can channel the orb's magic to hold your ground. For the next minute or until you move any distance, you have advantage on all checks and saving throws to resist effects
						that force you to move. In addition, any enemy that moves to a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC12 Strength saving throw or be unable to move any farther this turn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Stone Soul:</b><br>
						You can't be petrified.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Earthen Step:</b><br>
						You can cast <a href="./spells.html?l=MeldIntoStone"><i>Meld Into Stone</i></a> as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Gift of Stone:</b><br>
						You can transfer the orb's magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a pair of boots—by tracing the stein rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two
						items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the orb is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Shield:</b> The shield is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While you wield it, you have resistance to all damage dealt by ranged weapon attacks.</li>
						<li><b>Boots:</b> The pair of boots is now an uncommon magic item that requires attunement. While you wear the boots, you have advantage on Strength saving throws, and you can use your
							reaction to avoid being knocked prone.</li>

						While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's

					<p>

						This shard of ice is long and slender, roughly the size of a dagger. The ise (ice) rune glows within it. The shard has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Frigid Touch:</b><br>
						As an action, you can touch a body of water and freeze the water in a 10-foot-radius sphere around the spot you touched. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a
						short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Frost Friend:</b><br>
						You have resistance to fire damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Icy Mantle:</b><br>
						As an action, you can touch yourself or another creature with water on your finger. The water creates an icy mantle of protection. The next time within the next minute that the target takes
						bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, that damage is reduced to 0, and the mantle is destroyed. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Winter's Howl:</b><br>
						As an action, you can cast sleet storm (spell save DC 17). You regain this ability after you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Gift of Frost:</b><br>
						You can transfer the shard's magic to a nonmagical item—a cloak or a pair of boots—by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two
						items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Cloak:</b> The cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement. While wearing it, you have resistance to fire damage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made

						<i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal
						writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might
						have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=NightHag"><b>night hag's</b></a> curse.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Carrying Soul Coins:</b><br>
						To hold a <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many
						<i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> as it wishes (up to its maximum carrying capacity). A non-evil creature can carry a number of <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> equal to or less than
						its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack
						rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Using a <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i>:</b><br>
						A <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> and use it to do one of the
						following:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Drain Life:</b> You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</li>
						<li><b>Query:</b></li> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response. which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must
						answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
					</ul>
					<p>
						<b>Freeing a Soul:</b><br>
						Casting a spell that removes a curse on a <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within
						and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful
						evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemures.
					</p>
					<p>
						A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A <i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage
						except that which is dealt by a <a href="?f=HellfireWeapon"><i class="uncmnmagit">Hellfire Weapon</i></a> or an infernal war machine's furnace. Freeing a soul from a
						<i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coin</i> is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Hellish Currency:</b><br>
						<i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> are a currency of the Nine Hell s and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the
						unwilling. and reward the faithful for services rendered.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i class="uncmnmagit">Soul Coins</i> are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals
						are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.

						This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a
						<i class="lgndmagit">Sphere of Annihilation</i>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10
						force damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the
						sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 &times; your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A
						creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner
						of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the <a href="./spells.html?l=Gate"><i>Gate</i></a> spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a

						This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither good nor evil takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon

						The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If

						The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.

						Made by the drow, this rod is a magic weapon that ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within

					</p>
					<p>
						You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an
						extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is <a href="./combat.html?f=Stunned">stunned</a> until the end of its next turn.

						This thick leather-bound volume has a desiccated tongue pinned to the front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The grisly cover decoration on the
						first tome of the stilled tongue once belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich-god Vecna, keeper of secrets. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other
						spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this

					<p>
						While attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.

					<p>
						Vecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.

						<a href="?f=WeaponofWarning"><i class="uncmmagit">Weapon of Warning</i></a>. It can confer the benefit of a <a href="?f=CapofWaterBreathing"><i class="uncmmagit">Cap of Water Breathing</i></a>

					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Sentience:</i></b> <i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and
						darkvision out to a range of 120 feet
					</p>
					<p>
						The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a
						<a href="./spells.html?l=SpeakWithAnimals"><i>Speak With Animals</i></a> spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Personality:</i></b> When it grows restless, <i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea shanties to sacred hymns of the sea gods.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to
						further the weapon's objectives in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged 
						<i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, <i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> fears that it was intended to bring
						about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something <i class="lgndmagit">Wave</i> might not be able to avert

						This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

						You can use an action to unfold and place the <i class="lgndmagit">Well of Many Worlds</i> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence.
						Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once the

					<p>
						<i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.
					</p>
					<p>
						You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with <i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i>, you develop a fear of
						being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime
						sky.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Thrown Weapon:</i></b> <i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> has the thrown property, with a range of 20/60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra
						1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand
						free, the weapon lands at your feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Shock Wave:</i></b> You can use an action to strike the ground with <i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on
						the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC15 Constitution saving throw or become <a href="./combat.html?f=Stunned">stunned</a> for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
						saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Supernatural Awareness:</i></b> While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an
						action to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=DetectEvilandGood"><i>Detect Evil and Good</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=LocateObject"><i>Locate Object</i></a> from the weapon. Once you cast
						either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Sentience:</i></b> <i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out
						to a range of 120 feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish. Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Personality:</i></b> <i class="lgndmagit">Whelm's</i> purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder
						fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to
						protect those dwarves from harm.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. Hi will was strong enough that he bent
						<i class="lgndmagit">Whelm</i> to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.

			<h2 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h2>
			<p>
				An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, with its own origin and history. An artifact might have been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. It could have been created in the
				midst of a crisis that threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history. Some artifacts appear when they are needed most. For others,
				the reverse is true; when discovered, the world trembles at the ramifications of the find.
			</p>
			<h4>Artifact Properties</h4>
			<p>
				Each artifact has its own magical properties, as other magic items do, and the properties are often exceptionally powerful. An artifact might have other properties that are either beneficial or
				detrimental. The DM chooses such properties from the tables below or determines them randomly. They can also invent new beneficial and detrimental properties. These properties typically change
				each time an artifact appears in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				An artifact can have as many as four minor beneficial properties and two major beneficial properties. It can have as many as four minor detrimental properties and two major detrimental properties.
			</p>

			<h4>Destroying an Artifact</h4>
			<p>
				An artifact must be destroyed in some special way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Each artifact has a weakness by which its creation can be undone. Learning this weakness might require
				extensive research or the successful completion of a quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The artifact must be melted down in the volcano, forge, or crucible in which it was created.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be swallowed and digested by <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=TheTarrasque"><b>the tarrasque</b></a> or some other ancient creature.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god or an angel.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special weapon crafted for that purpose.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic gears of Mechanus.</li>
				<li>The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can destroy it by touch.</li>
			</ul>

				<p><i>Battleaxe</i></p>
				<p>
					Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.
				</p>
				<p>
					Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he
					first crafted four great tools: the <i>Brutal Pick</i>, the <i>Earthheart Forge</i>, the <i>Anvil of Songs</i>, and the <i>Shaping Hammer</i>. With them, he forged the
					<i class="artimagit">Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and
					enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful
					inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still
					search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Weapon Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a
					<a href="?f=BeltofDwarvenkind"><i class="raremagit">Belt of Dwarvenkind</i></a>, a <a href="?f=DwarvenThrower"><i class="vryrmagit">Dwarven Thrower</i></a>, and a
					<a href="?f=SwordofSharpness"><i class="vryrmagit">Sword of Sharpness</i></a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 Minor Beneficial Properties</li>
					<li>1 Major Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>2 Minor Detrimental Properties</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Blessings of Moradin:</b> If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You have immunity to poison damage.</li>
					<li>The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</li>
					<li>You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Conjure Earth Elemental:</b> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=ConjureElemental"><i>Conjure Elemental</i></a> spell from it, summoning
					an <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=EarthElemental"><b>earth elemental</b></a>. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Travel the Depths:</b> You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Teleport"><i>Teleport</i></a> spell from the axe. If
					your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Curse:</b> The axe bears a curse that affects any nondwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical
					appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf.
					The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a
					<a href="./spells.html?l=GreaterRestoration"><i>Greater Restoration</i></a> or <a href="./spells.html?l=RemoveCurse"><i>Remove Curse</i></a> spell.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Axe:</b> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the <i>Earthheart Forge</i>, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it
					finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.

				<p>
					The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled <i class="artimagit">Book of Exalted Deeds</i> figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture
					devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <i class="artimagit">Book of Exalted Deeds</i> rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring
					light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and
					firm of purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the
					book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the
					text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be
					reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.
				</p>
				<p>
					Benefits granted by the <i class="artimagit">Book of Exalted Deeds</i> last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the
					span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Book of Exalted Deeds</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 Minor Beneficial Properties</li>
					<li>2 Major Beneficial Properties</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Increased Wisdom:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the
					book more than once.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Enlightened Magic:</b> Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Halo:</b> Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or
					manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to
					interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Book:</b> It is rumored that the <i class="artimagit">Book of Exalted Deeds</i> can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the
					River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.

				<p>
					The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to
					even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i>. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest
					magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were
					writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches
					that the original text can't be divined.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and
					turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that
					those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment
					changes to evil.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days,
					or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your
					soul remains imprisoned.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Vile Lore:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> touches on every evil in the cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains to unearth terrible secrets no mortal
					should know. Among the contents a character might find are the following, plus whatever else the DM might add:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Vile Apotheosis:</b> The book could hold a ritual that allows a character to become a lich or death knight.</li>
					<li><b>True Names:</b> The true names of any number of fiends might be in the book.</li>
					<li><b>Dark Magic:</b> Several spells of horrific evil of the DM's design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human sacrifice,
						afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile plagues, and so on.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>3 Minor Beneficial Properties</li>
					<li>1 Major Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>3 Minor Detrimental Properties</li>
					<li>2 Major Detrimental Properties</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Adjusted Ability Scores:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability
					score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Mark of Darkness:</b> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An
					evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a
					forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation)
					checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Command Evil:</b> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the <i>Dominate Monster</i> spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property
					again until the next dawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Dark Lore:</b> You can reference the <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about
					demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Dark Speech:</b> While you carry the <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark
					Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Book:</b> For as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book can't be permanently destroyed. The <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i> allows pages to be torn from
					it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=a"><b>solar</b></a> tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.
				</p>
				<p>
					A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book
					in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 &times; 100 years later.

					Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with
					existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <i class="artimagit">Crook of Rao</i> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch
					Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse—and the potential for
					future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat,
					few risk using the Crook of Rao—potentially for the final time.

					<b>Spells:</b> The crook has 6 charges, and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following

					<b>Iggwilv's Curse:</b> When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the
					crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <i class="artimagit">Crook of Rao</i>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and
					exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent <a href="./spells.html?l=Gate"><i>Gate</i></a> spell cast by lggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative
					count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <i class="artimagit">Crook of Rao</i>. If the fiend still exists,
					it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying or Repairing the Crook:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Crook of Rao</i> can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally
					serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves
					if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

				<p>
					An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the <i class="artimagit">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i> is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the
					multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's
					spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps
					the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 Minor Beneficial Properties</li>
					<li>1 Minor Detrimental Property</li>
					<li>1 Major Detrimental Property</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Spells:</b> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to a number of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save
					DC 20) from it:
					0 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=HideousLaughter"><i>Hideous Laughter</i></a><br>
					1 Charge: <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicCircle"><i>Magic Circle</i></a><br>
					2 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=PlanarBinding"><i>Planar Binding</i><br>
					3 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicJar"><i>Magic Jar</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=PlanarAlly"><i>Planar Ally</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=PlaneShift"><i>Plane Shift</i></a> (to
					layers of the Abyss only), <a href="./spells.html?l=SummonFiend"><i>Summon Fiend</i></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Abyssal Reference:</b> You can reference the <i class="artimagit">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival)
					check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Fiendish Scourging:</b> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result
					instead of rolling.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ensnarement:</b> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicCircle"><i>Magic Circle</i></a> spell naming only fiends, or the
					<a href="./spells.html?l=PlanarBinding"><i>Planar Binding</i></a> spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally,
					the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Containment:</b> The first 10 pages of the <i class="artimagit">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i> are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is
					trapped within a <a href="./spells.html?l=MagicCircle"><i>Magic Circle</i></a>. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the
					Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.<br>
					When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You 
					must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the
					closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.<br>
					When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Demonomicon:</b> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all
					those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain
					lies a long-lost artifact, <i>Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff</i>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <i>Tome of Zyx</i>, the
					work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows.

				<p>
					Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his
					power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.
				</p>
				<p>
					Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered
					and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider
					Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's
					rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will
					in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <i class="artimagit">Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i class="artimagit">Hand of Vecna</i> might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The
					hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.
				</p>
				<p>
					To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye
					transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.
				</p>
				<p>
					To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the
					hand is ever removed, you die.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i class="artimagit">Hand of Vecna</i> each have the following random properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 Minor Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>1 Major Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>1 Minor Detrimental Property</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Properties of the Eye:</b> Your alignment changes to evil, and you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You have truesight</li>
					<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a <a href="?f=RingofXrayVision"><i class="raremagit">Ring of X-ray Vision</i></a>. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</li>
					<li>The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:<br>
						1 Charge: <a href="./spells.html?l=CrownofMadness"><i>Crown of Madness</i></a><br>
						2 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=Clairvoyance"><i>Clairvoyance</i></a><br>

						<a href="./spells.html?l=Eyebite"><i>Eyebite</i></a><br>
						The eye regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5% chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes
						control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Properties of the Hand:</b> Your alignment changes to evil, and you gain the following benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>
					<li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li>
					<li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:<br>
						1 Charge: <a href="./spells.html?l=Sleep"><i>Sleep</i></a><br>
						2 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=Slow"><i>Slow</i></a><br>
						3 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=Teleport"><i>Teleport</i></a><br>
						5 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=FingerofDeath"><i>Finger of Death</i></a><br>
						The hand regains 1d4+4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the <a href="./spells.html?l=Suggestion"><i>Suggestion</i></a> spell on you
						(save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Properties of the Eye and Hand:</b> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You are immune to disease and poison.</li>
					<li>Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</li>
					<li>You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.</li>
					<li>If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.</li>
					<li>If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the <i class="artimagit">Hand of Vecna</i>. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack
						against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On hit, the target must succeed on a DC18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit
						points.</li>
					<li>You can use an action to cast <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a>. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Eye and Hand:</b> If the <i class="artimagit">Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i class="artimagit">Hand of Vecna</i> are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain
					by the <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i>, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but
					the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.

				<p>
					Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked
					their greatest magic, forging five <i class="artimagit">Orbs of Dragonkind</i> (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were
					used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries,
					so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a resence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.
				</p>
				<p>
					An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peeer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC15 Charisma check. on a successful check, you control the orb for
					as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts <a hfer="./spells.html?l=Suggestion"><i>Suggestion</i> on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it
					desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of
					Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> An <i class="artimagit">Orb of Dragonkind</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 Minor Beneficial Properties</li>
					<li>1 Minor Detrimental Property</li>
					<li>1 Major Detrimental Property</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Spells:</b> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend a number of charges to cast one of the following
					spells (save DC 18) from it:<br>
					0 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=DetectMagic"><i>Detect Magic</i></a><br>
					1 Charge: <a href="./spells.html?l=Daylight"><i>Daylight</i></a><br>
					2 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=DeathWard"><i>Death Ward</i></a><br>
					3 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> (5th-level version), <a href="./spells.html?l=Scrying"><i>Scrying</i></a><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Call Dragons:</b> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel
					compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for
					compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying an Orb:</b> An <i class="artimagit">Orb of Dragonkind</i> appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A
					<a href="./spells.html?l=Disintegrate"><i>Disintegrate</i></a>
					spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

				<p><i>Longsword</i></p>
				<p>
					When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and
					assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead.
					Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i> is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals
					an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage.
					On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the <a href="./spells.html?l=DominateMonster"><i>Dominate Monster</i></a> spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in
					blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Random Properties:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i> has the following randomly determined properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 Minor Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>1 Major Beneficial Property</li>
					<li>1 Minor Detrimental Property</li>
					<li>1 Major Detrimental Property</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<b>Spirit of Kas:</b> While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can
					transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remaiin effect until the start of your next turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Spells:</b> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:
					<a href="./spells.html?l=CallLightning"><i>Call Lightning</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=DivineWord"><i>Divine Word</i></a>, or
					<a href="./spells.html?l=FingerofDeath"><i>Finger of Death</i></a>. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sentience:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i> is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out
					to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Personality:</b> The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.<br>
					The <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i> also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the </a><i class="artimagit">Eye and Hand of Vecna</i>. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually
					becomes a fixation for its wielder.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Sword:</b> A creature attuned to both the <i class="artimagit">Eye of Vecna</i> and the <i class="artimagit">Hand of Vecna</i> can use the <i>Wish</i> property of those combined
					artifacts to unmake the <i class="artimagit">Sword of Kas</i>. The creature must cast the <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>Wish</i></a> spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must
					be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the <a href="./spells.html?l=Wish"><i>wish</i></a> spell is wasted. If the sword loses

					appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to
					the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the
					creature dies and rises as a <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Zombie"><b>zombie</b></a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on
					a hit

					<b>Spells:</b> The wand has 7 charges. The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the
					following spells (save DC 18) from it:<br>
					1 Charge: <a href="./spells.html?l=AnimateDead"><i>Animate Dead</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=SpeakWithDead"><i>Speak With Dead</i></a><br>
					2 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=Blight"><i>Blight</i></a><br>
					3 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=CircleofDeath"><i>Circle of Death</i></a>, <a href="./spells.html?l=FingerDeath"><i>Finger of Death</i></a><br>
					4 Charges: <a href="./spells.html?l=PowerWordKill"><i>Power Word Kill</i></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Call Undead:</b> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Skeleton"><b>skeletons</b></a> and
					<a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Zombie"><b>zombies</b></a>, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise
					up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate
					piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses
					them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Sentience:</b> The <i class="artimagit">Wand of Orcus</i> is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out
					to a range of 120 feet. The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Personality:</b> The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its
					master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Destroying the Wand:</b> Destroying the <i class="artimagit">Wand of Orcus</i> requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to
					happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.

				A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each
				animal's speed and base carrying capacity. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the
				vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts
				(<a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Pegasus"><b>pegasi</b></a>, <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Griffin"><b>griffins</b></a>, <a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=Hippogriff"><b>hippogriffs</b></a>, and
				similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (<a href="../dg/monsters.html?l=GiantSeaHorse"><b>giant sea horses</b></a>, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the
				creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
			</p>
			<h4>Barding</h4>
			<p>
				Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table on the Armor & Weapons tab can be purchased as barding. The cost is four
				times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

				A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding
				any aquatic or flying mount.
			</p>
			<h2 id="shipping">Ships (Water Vehicles)</h2><!-- I elected to eschew the airship since it didn't get an overhaul in GoS -->
			<p>
				Over the course of an adventure or campaign, you might gain custody of a ship. A ship can be bought, captured, or temporarily given out for the sake of a mission. A ship consists of many separate
				parts and are usually operated by multiple people, as described below.
			</p>
			<h4>Officers on a Ship</h4>
			<p>
				A ship needs officers to oversee its operations—officers who fill six different roles. Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Other roles focus on
				keeping the crew's health and morale in order. The roles are meant to provide a sense of the types of ability checks useful to managing a ship. Of these, though, captain is the only role that must
				be filled for the ship to function. A ship needs a single person to issue orders and respond to threats, otherwise a ship risks chaos and confusion during a crisis. A paid for NPC officer is a
				skilled hireling.
			</p>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>Captain</b><br>
				The captain issues orders. The best captains have high Intelligence and Charisma scores, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and the Intimidation and Persuasion skills. 
			</div>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>First Mate</b><br>
				The first mate keeps the crew's morale high by providing supervision, encouragement. and discipline. A first mate benefits from a high Charisma score, as well as proficiency with the Intimidation
				and Persuasion skills.
			</div>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>Bosun</b><br>
				The bosun (or boatswain) provides technical advice to the captain and crew and leads repair and maintenance efforts. A good bosun has a high Strength score, as well as proficiency with carpenter's
				tools and the Athletics skill.
			</div>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>Quartermaster</b><br>
				The quartermaster plots the ship's course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable quartermaster tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as
				proficiency with navigator's tools and the Nature skill. 
			</div>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>Surgeon</b><br>
				The ship's surgeon tends to injuries, keeps illnesses from spreading throughout the ship, and oversees sanitation. A capable surgeon benefits from a high Intelligence score, as well as proficiency
				with herbalism kits and the Medicine skill.
			</div>
			<div class="cmbtactn">
				<b>Cook</b><br>
				A ship's cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew's morale in top shape. while a poor one drags down the entire crew's performance. A
				talented cook has a high Constitution score, as well as proficiency with brewer's supplies and cook's utensils.
			</div>
			<h4>Crew</h4>
			<p>
				A ship also requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it. A crew's skill, experience, morale. and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship
				activities, like the crew's ability to notice threats or contend with hazards. A crew starts with a quality score of +4. but that score varies over time, going as low as -10 and as high as +10. It
				decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good healthcare, and receives fair leadership. An ordinary crewmember
				is an unskilled hireling.
			</p>
			<p>
				A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew's quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check modified
				by the crew's quality score. If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew's quality score decreases by 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard. The crew can be cowed into obedience
				through violence, combat, or offers of treasure or other rewards. When the DM ends the mutiny, the crew's quality score increases by 1d4. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Shore Leave</b><br>
				Life aboard a ship is a constant wear on the crew. Spending time in port allows the crew to relax and regain its composure. If a crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the score increases by 1 for each
				day the crew spends in port or ashore.
			</p>
			<h4>The Ship Itself</h4>
			<p>
				A ship stat block has three main parts: basic statistics, components, and action options. Ships can't take any actions on their own. Without effort from its crew, a ship might drift on the water,
				come to a stop, or careen out of control. The statistics and components are described here in the order they appear in the stat block.
			</p>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Size</b><br>
				Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the
				size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan. 
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Space</b><br>
				A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space. A ship can't move into a space
				that is too small to accommodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, see <a href="./combat.html?l=shipcombt">Ship Combat</a>. 
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Capacity</b><br>
				A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers don't generally
				engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the deep both count as passengers. Cargo capacity
				notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity. 
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Capacity</b><br>
				A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. The number assumes Medium or
				Small creatures, though a larger creature can generally be assumed to take up twice as many passenger slots as <a href="./combat.html?l=gridplay">the spaces it occupies on a square-based
				battlefield</a>. Passengers don't generally engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the
				deep both count as passengers. The passenger capacity denotes the amount of people that can semi-comfortably fit aboard the ship. A galley, keelboat, sailing ship, or warship can carry many more
				people by oncomfortably packing them in its holds and cabins, mainly limited by its cargo capacity. Uncomfortable packing of this kind is mainly done when a ship is transporting a landing force of
				soldiers or slaves for sale. Cargo capacity notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity. 
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Travel Pace</b><br>
				A ship's travel pace determines how far the vessel can move per hour and per day. A ship's movement-related components (described in its stat block) determine how far the vessel can move each round.
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Ability Scores</b><br>
				A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers.<br>
				The Strength of a ship expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Ships usually
				have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Vulnerabilites, Resistances, &amp; Immunities</b><br>
				A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.
			</div>
			<h4>Components</h4>
			<p>
				<span class="noindent">A</span> ship is composed of different components, each of which comprises multiple objects. A ship's component might have special rules, as described in the stat block.<br>
				<b>Hull:</b> A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.<br>
				<b>Control:</b> A control component is used to steer a ship. A destroyed control component usually doesn't mean the ship can't move outright. Rather, the penalty is noted in the ship's statblock.<br>
				<b>Movement:</b> A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars, and has a specific speed.<br>
				<b>Weapon:</b> A ship expecting combat might be outfitted with one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately. These weapons are usually siege weapons, described further under
				"Siege Equipment" as seen to the left. The ships here assume a world with no gunpowder. Ships in a world where firearms exist have cannons instead of their listed implements here.
			</p>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Armor Class</b><br>
				A component has an Armor Class. Its AC reflects the materials used to construct it and any defensive plating used to augment its toughness.
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Hit Points</b><br>
				A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed. A ship doesn't have Hit Dice.
			</div>
			<div class="invocation">
				<b>Damage Threshold</b><br>
				If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage that equals or exceeds its
				threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Damage that fails to bypass the threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points. 
			</div>

				<p>
					Galleys are long vessels that rely on sails and sizable rowing crews to move. These ships can carry siege weapons and soldiers to war or transport large amounts of cargo for merchants. No matter
					the ship's purpose, the crew almost always hires extra protection, since galleys make large, cargo-rich targets for pirates. A fully equipped galley costs 30,000 gp to procure. A galley has the
					following features, spread across its two decks:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Ballistas</b><br>
					Four ballistas are attached to the fore of the main deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured near each.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Cargo Holds</b><br>
					Cargo holds at the fore and aft of the lower deck hold crates, barrels, and ammunition secured with rope.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Ceilings</b><br>
					The ceiling of the galley's lower deck is 2.5 meters high.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Light</b><br>
					Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ship.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Mangonels</b><br>
					Two mangonels are attached to the aft of the main deck. Ten mangonel stones are stacked and secured near each catapult. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Naval Ram</b><br>
					The galley's stern features an iron naval ram used for attacking other ships.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Oars</b><br>
					Thirty-two benches are built into the lower deck, each with a 20-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Ten spare oars hang on the walls. If
					its oars are broken, the galley can't slow down manually.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Opening</b><br>
					A 10-foot-wide, 80-foot-long open space in the middle of the main deck stretches fore to aft and leads down to the lower deck.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Railing</b><br>
					A 3-foot-high rail is built around the main deck's perimeter, providing half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Rigging</b><br>
					Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Rowboat</b><br>
					Eight rowboats are stacked in two groups of four on the main deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Sails</b><br>
					The galley has one 120-foot-tall mast with sails to catch the wind. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Kettle Drum</b><br>
					A kettle drum with two attached mallets sits on the aft of the main deck just before the opening to the lower deck. A crew member plays this instrument while the sailors on the lower deck row,
					the beat helping to synchronize the rowers' strokes. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Wheel</b><br>
					The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the main deck.
				</div>
				<h4>A Galley's Crew</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">A</span> galley requires a total of 48 crewmembers to function properly. It requires an additional 32 combatants to be properly crewed for war, totalling 80. This accounts
					for:
				</p>
				<ul>

				<p>
					One of the smallest sailing vessels, keelboats can be operated by a handful of people. These ships often transport small amounts of cargo or passengers. They're perfect for pleasure cruises, as
					they're easier and less expensive to operate than larger vessels. A fully equipped keelboat costs 3000 gp to procure. A keelboat has the following features across its deck and cabin:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Ballista*</b><br>
					*<i>A Keelboat only has a ballista if it expects to see combat. Most don't.</i><br>
					A ballista is mounted on the fore of the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.

					down manually.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Railing</b><br>
					A 3-foot-high rail is built around the main deck's perimeter, providing half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.

				<img loading="lazy" style="width:50%;" src="../Stylefiles/otherimg/longship.webp">
				<p>
					Longships are light, elegant vessels that rely on a rowing crew and sails to move across the sea. A longship is typically used for raiding or troop transport. Its extremely shallow draft lets it
					operate in waters only a meter deep, and its light construction allows the crew to carry it over land if the need arises. A fully equipped longship costs 7000 gp and has the following features:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Light</b><br>
					Hanging lanterns cast bright light over the deck.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Oars</b><br>
					The longship carries 40 15-foot-long oars, 32 for active use and 8 spare. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on chests containing their personal belongings to work the oars. If its oars
					are broken, the longship can't slow down manually.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Railing</b><br>
					A 3-foot-high rail is built around the deck's perimeter, providing half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.

					<b>Rigging</b><br>
					Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.

				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Rudder</b><br>
					The ship is steered by a rudder control on the aft of the deck.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Sail</b><br>
					The longship has one 35-foot-tall mast with a single sail to catch the wind. The mast can be lowered and raised quickly (in about 90 seconds) to respond to wind conditions.

					certainly can be, especially the role of first mate. It is also ordinarily double-crewed, with its sailors working in shifts. To operate smoothly, a longship needs:
				</p>

				<p>
					Warships are heavy, well-equipped vessels meant for ship-to-ship combat. They are often elaborately decorated, sporting figureheads at the fore and colorful carvings and paintings across the
					railings and aft. They are most often used for blockades and short-distance troop transport, in the latter case transporting hundreds of combatants at a time. A generic, fully outfitted warship,
					which costs 25,000 gp, has the following accomodations, across which its features are distributed:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Ceilings</b><br>
					The ceilings in the lower deck, holds, and cabins are 8 feet high with 6-foot-high doorways. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Doors</b><br>
					The ship's doors are made of wood and have AC 15, 18 hit points, and immuity to poison and psychic damage. A lock can be picked with a successful DC15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools,
					or the door can be forced open with a successful DC20 Strength (Athletics) check.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Footlockers</b><br>
					Footlockers on the ship are iron and have AC 19, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Light</b><br>
					Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ship.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Rigging</b><br>
					Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Sails</b><br>
					The ship has three 80-foot-tall masts with sails to catch the wind. 
				</div>
				<h4>Armory</h4>
				<p>
					The ship's supply of weapons and armor is held in its armory, the walls of which are fitted with built-in weapon and armor racks. The door to this cabin is usually locked, the key kept by one of
					the ship's officers.
				</p>
				<h4>Captain's Quarters</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">T</span>he captain's quarters hold a bed and a desk. Beneath the bed is an iron footlocker that holds the captain's belongings.
				</p>
				<h4>Forecastle</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">T</span>he forecastle is a raised deck at the fore of the ship. Beneath the forecastle are rooms where ship maintenance supplies and extra siege weapon ammunition is kept.
					The top of the forecastle is equipped with:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Ballista</b><br>
					A ballista is attached to the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Railing</b><br>
					The forecastle has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.
				</div>
				<h4>Guest Cabin or Brig</h4>
				<p>
					The sailing ship has three small cabins for high ranking passengers to inhabit. In a pinch, they can also be used to incarcerate insubordinate crewmembers or other captives. It also has a large
					cabin under its forecastle which is used for traveling families, as an officer's quarter (see the warship), or as another hold depending on what the ship is carrying.
				</p>
				<h4>Hold</h4>
				<p>
					The sailing ship is mostly hold, spread across its two lower decks. The hold houses both passengers and cargo. The ship's off-duty crew sleep on bedrolls among the crates and barrels of food,
					water, and other supplies. 
				</p>
				<h4>Main Deck</h4>
				<p>
					The ship's main deck is connected to its forecastle, quarterdeck, and lower deck by staircases, and to its captain's quarters and one or more other cabins by doors. It carries the following
					features:
				</p>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Hatch</b><br>
					A covered, 10-foot-square opening leads to the lower deck. It is used for loading large and especially heavy pieces of cargo onto the ship. 

				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Mangonels</b><br>
					Two mangonels are attached to the deck. Each weapon has 10 mangonel stones stacked and secured near it. 
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Railing</b><br>
					The main deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.
				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Rowboat</b><br>
					Four rowboats are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water. 
				</div>
				<h4>Medical Cabin</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">H</span>ooks and shelves on the walls hold medical instruments. bandages, balms, tonics, jars of leeches, and more, ready to treat injuries from combat or sailing mishaps.
				</p>
				<h4>Oar Deck</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty-two benches are built into the lower deck, each with a 20-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Ten spare oars hang on the walls of
					the ship. If its oars are broken, the ship can't slow down manually.
				</p>
				<h4>Officer's Quarters</h4>
				<p>
					Four beds stand in the officer's quarters. Beneath each is an iron footlocker that holds the officers' belongings. The officers sleep in shifts so someone remains on duty to command the crew and
					carry out the captain's orders. 
				</p>
				<h4>Privy</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">P</span>enches line the walls of this room. Four holes carved in them house chamber pots. 
				</p>
				<h4>Quarterdeck</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="noindent">T</span>he quarterdeck is a raised deck at the aft of the ship. it is equipped with:

				</div>
				<div class="invocation">
					<b>Wheel</b><br>
					The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the quarterdeck.
				</div>
				<h4>A Sailing Ship's Crew</h4>
				<p>
					While a warship can be sailed with only about a dozen people, it requres some 30 crewmembers to operate smoothly, and even more to be properly staffed. A warship going into battle requires at
					least all of the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All six officer types</li>
					<li>Twenty-five sailors</li>
					<li>Eight siege engineers</li>
					<li>Forty warriors to fend off boarders and capture other ships</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 id="shipgrades">Ship Upgrades</h2>
			<p>
				Some vessels possess extraordinary abilities, whether due to magic or superior artisanship. The upgrades below can replace a ship's existing components or provide a new element to augment a ship's
				abilities. Adding an upgrade costs 15,000 gp and requires that the ship is in port for 1d4 weeks of work.
			</p>
			<h4>Hull Upgrades</h4>
			<p title="as opposed to a ship without a hull?">
				<span class="noindent">A</span>ny ship with a hull can gain one of the following upgrades. In some cases, a hull upgrade can also provide a benefit to the ship's other components. 
			</p>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Churning Hull</b>
				</summary>
				A tempest rages within these rune-etched, iron chains. Raiders and pirates who operate under the blessings of a storm god sometimes make use of this upgrade. By draping the chains over a ship's
				hull, the storm's fury thrashes into the water around it. The water within 210 feet of the ship is difficult terrain for everything other than this ship. 
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Death Vessel</b>
				</summary>
				Crafted with materials harvested from the Shadowfell, this upgrade grants a ship an aura of dread. As an action, the ship can create a pulse of horrific energy. Every creature that is an enemy of
				the ship who is on board or within 210 feet of it must make DC14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is <a href="./combat.html?f=Frightened">frightened</a> of the ship for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature is
				immune to this ability for 24 hours. Once this ability is used. it can't be used again until 1d4 hours have passed. 
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Frost-Locked Hull</b>
				</summary>
				This upgrade replaces a ship's hull with supernatural ice drawn from the elemental planes. The hull and the other components of the ship are immune to cold damage but vulnerable to fire damage. The
				ship can also move at its normal speed over ice of any thickness, floating on the ice at the same depth as it would in water.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Living Vessel</b>
				</summary>
				This vessel's hull was crafted in the Feywild under the direction of master eladrin shipwrights. It is a living plant. drawing sustenance from water and sunlight. Vines covered in thick leaves hang
				over its side, and the wood runs with fresh sap when damaged. The ship gains a +2 bonus to all Constitution checks or saving throws. As long as the ship has at least 1 hit point, it regains 10 hit
				points every minute. 
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">

			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Defiant Sails</b>
				</summary>
				These sails glitter with a fine coat of mithral treated with abjuration magic. While the sails are unfurled. ranged weapon attacks made against the ship and anyone aboard it are made with
				disadvantage, as a result of the sails' protective magic. This drawback doesn't apply if the attacker is aboard the ship.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Dragon Sails</b>

			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Concussive Rounds</b>
				</summary>

				ship's actions. The golem remains animated for 1 minute. At the end of that time, it teleports back to its position as a figu rehead. Once a ship uses this action, it can't use it again for 24
				hours. 
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Red Dragon Figurehead</b>

				a DC12 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, it dies as normal. If it fails, it immediately rises as a zombie obedient to the ship's captain. The zombie gains a working knowledge of the ship,
				allowing it to serve as a member of the crew. A number of creatures equal to the ship's creature capacity can be animated in this manner at any given time.
			</details>
			<details class="invocation">
				<summary>
					<b>Smuggler's Banner</b>

				viewers might see different flags or crests.<br>
				The banner's true power is its ability to aid a ship in making rapid escapes. As an action, the ship and all friendly creatures aboard it teleport up to 3 miles to a known destination of the
				captain's choice. Hostile creatures aboard the ship don't move with the ship and fall into the water it once occupied. Once this item is used to teleport, it can't teleport in this way again for 2d6
				days.

				It's not unusual for adventurers—especially at higher levels—to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force,
				obtain it in a lucky draw from a <a href="?l=DeckofManyThings"><i class="lgndmagit">Deck of Many Things</i></a>, or acquire it by other means.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn't included here because it falls under living expenses, see the Finance tab.)
				Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party's absence.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs by
				charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table.
			</p>
			<h4>Businesses</h4>
			<p>
				An adventurer-owned business can earn enough money to cover its own maintenance costs. However, the owner needs to periodically ensure that everything is running smoothly by tending to the business
				between adventures.
			</p>
			<h4>Garrisons</h4>
			<p>
				Castles and keeps employ soldiers (a mix of <a href="..//dg/monsters.html?l=Veteran"><b>veterans</b></a> and <a href="..//dg/monsters.html?l=Guard"><b>guards</b></a>) to defend them. Roadside inns,
				outposts and forts, palaces, and temples rely on less-experienced defenders (typically only guards). These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property's skilled hirelings.

				You can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, you must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, you will need a royal
				charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to you for as long as you remain loyal
				to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means. You can attempt to build on land you don't own, but doing so
				will likely lead to a lot of trouble once the construction is discovered by the authorities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as
				little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the estate is secured, you need access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the
				amount of time it takes, provided that you are using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while you are away, but each day you are adds 3 days to the construction time.

				A character who owns a business can spend their downtime attempting to make sure it runs smoothly. Depending on the nature of the business and the work the character does, the appriopriate downtime
				activity might be "Work", as described on the Other Rules page, but if it <i>is</i> this one, use the following rules:
			</p>
			<p>
				For every workweek spent on running your business, roll a d100 and add your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers. Depending on the nature of your work, the DM might also let you add your
				modifier, including proficiency bonus, for a tool or skill, or roll with advantage. Once all modifiers are applied, consult the table to the right to see what happens.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the result demands that you pay a cost but you fail to do so, your business begins to fail as it goes into debt. For each unpaid debt incurred this way, you take a -10 penalty to subsequent rolls
				made to run your business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Running a business comes with many complications, most of them related to mismanaged money, but there might also be a supply shortage, a drought, or you might be subject to extortion. Depending on
				the type of business you run, the possible complications are vary too wildly to be listed. As such they are entirely up to the DM, but the risk of encountering one of some kind is 10% every week.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the rules above are not absolute. The size of the business, which can be anything from a small farmstead to an international mining operation, determines the income it can generate. Work
				with your DM to think of reasonable sums for your own personalized table. You can also likely hire competent managers and the like to help you run your business. The contributions of such employees
				are determined by the DM, but migth for example involve a bonus to your roll on the table.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sieging">Siege Equipment</h2>
			<p>
				It is not unrealistic for characters, especially ones with a fortified stronghold, to find themselves in a siege situation over the course of a camapign, whether as the attackers or the defenders.
				Here are some weapons that might be involved. Many of them can also be found on battlefields as field artillery, or on ships meant for combat.

				A cannon uses gunpowder to propel heavy balls of cast iron through the air at destructive speeds. In a campaign without gunpowder, a cannon might be an arcane device built by clever gnomes or

				A ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains. The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors and barricades. It takes a minimum of
				four Medium creatures to operate a ram. Because of the gallery roof, these operators have total cover against attacks from above.
