				<p>
					These mutations were designed to be applied to PCs exposed to magical toxins in a dungeon run campaign. No special consideration have been given to their individual impact or power level. Rather,
					they are meant to facilitate emergent story telling. The mutations are meant to be gained fairly frequently and can often stack with themselves, limited mainly by common sense. (Your hair can't
					turn into snakes if it is already snakes, for instance)

				<summary><h4>Dr. Drohlin's Mutation Tables for Creatures</h4></summary>
				<p>
					Below are tables outlining genetic or magical mutations that you can use to make your creatures more flavourful, interesting, or simply more challenging. These mutations could represent regional
					variations of species, or perhaps the experiments of a mad wizard. You may select or roll for mutations on the tables below. One or more of these could be applied to an individual creature, a
					group of creatures (i.e. a pack or herd), or for a creature's entire species in your world. Many of these mutations can be used to re-flavour a creature to fit in a particular environment, and we
					have indicated which environments match which mutation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of these mutations make the creature more resilient or dangerous, sometimes by a significant amount depending on its initial stat block. We recommend increasing the CR of a mutated creature
					by between 0, ½, or 1 for minor mutations and 2 or 3 for major mutations, although some mutations may only increase a creature's CR under certain circumstances (e.g., the #2 Minor Mutation
					“Extended apnea” only poses an increased threat while fighting underwater). To ensure that these mutations scale with CR, we've included some that utilise stat bonuses and proficiency bonuses
					(abbreviated to “PB”) to calculate save DCs, hit bonuses, and damage. Ultimately, how you balance these changes is up to your discretion, so if you find that these mutations are
					over/underwhelming in some situations, please do adjust them to fit your needs.

			<h2>Supernatural Regions</h2>
			<p>
				Not all lands thrive as nature intended. Magical forces, strange interlopers, or tragic events can alter an area's destiny, fundamentally changing the land. While the flora, fauna, structures, and
				inhabitants might remain unaffected, the land's innate character takes on new qualities. A supernatural region is permeated by a preter￾natural force in an area as large or small as you wish. In the
				affected area, certain effects and brief encounters reinforce an underlying theme. These effects occur as characters traverse an influenced region or add interest to a specific affected location.
				The descriptions of the following supernatural regions summarize the region, present a table of potential effects within the affected area, and note triggers for a random effect. Feel free to
				customize the effects of each region to suit any adventure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The effects of a region occur whenever you please, at the time each description suggests, or under one or more of the following circumstances: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Soon after the party first enters the region</li>
				<li>When a creature loses more than half its hit points</li>
				<li>When a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher</li>
				<li>When a creature activates a magic item</li>
				<li>When a creature makes an exceptionally loud noise or otherwise attracts attention</li>
				<li>When the party spends at least 30 minutes in the same region</li>

				<p>When magical currents become trapped amid winds and clouds, eldritch storms can result.</p>
				<ul style="width:70%;">
					<li><b><i>Flaywind:</i></b> Supernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense
						sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 1d4 slashing damage at
						the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.<br>
						A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC15 Intelligence (Arcana) or (Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1
						minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts 1d4&times;10 hours.</li>
					<li><b><i>Flame Storm:</i></b>  Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes 2d6 fire damage
						at the start of each of its turns. The droplets <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Ignited">ignite</a> any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out
						immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged attack rolls.<br>
						A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.</li>
					<li><b><i>Necrotic Tempest:</i></b> Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that
						isn't a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 necrotic damage.<br>
						A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a <a href="./monsters.html?l=Skeleton"><b>skeleton</b></a> or <a href="./monsters.html?l=Zombie"><b>zombie</b></a> (your choice) 1d10
						minutes later.<br>
						A necrotic tempest lasts for 1d4 hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for 1d4 days after its passing.</li>
					<li><b><i>Thrym's Howl:</i></b> These bone-chilling blizzards drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. The storm projects <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=environmenttop">extreme cold</a>.
						Due to the howling wind and dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks made within it have disadvantage.<br>
						Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can't regain hit points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm environment. A creature that dies in
						the storm freezes solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage are immune to the effects of the storm and can see normally within it. Thrym's howl typically lasts 2d10 hours.</li>

					<h4>Emotional Echoes</h4>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Occasionally a place becomes infused with the powerful emotions of those who once dwelt, worked, celebrated, or suffered there. Areas with emotional echoes are typically associated with one
					common emotion, such as joy or sorrow. Such an area might be as small as a room in a house or as large as a forest. Once per day, if a creature within the area expresses even the faintest hint
					of the prevailing emotion, the land seeks to hold onto that creature and inspire it to produce more of the feeling tied to the emotional echo. The creature is targeted by a
					<a href="../pg/spells.html?l=Suggestion"><i>Suggestion</i></a> spell (DC16), with the intent of making it linger in the area and perform an act related to its associated emotion. The effect
					lasts 24 hours. The following list notes some of the most common emotional echoes, where they tend to appear, and how they typically influence creatures: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Boldness:</i></b> Appears in battlefields and echoing canyons, encouraging creatures to shout hidden truths and act out their greatest victories.</li>
					<li><b><i>Doubt:</i></b>Appears around cliffs or deserts and makes creatures hesitate, mistrusting their ability to climb or escape their current difficulties.</li>
					<li><b><i>Fear:</i></b> Appears in caves and ruins, overwhelming creatures with dread and urging them to give voice to their deepest fears.</li>
					<li><b><i>Hatred:</i></b> Appears in volcanic regions and provokes creatures to scream and destroy things.</li>
					<li><b><i>Inspiration:</i></b> Appears around memorials or natural wonders, causing creatures to create works of art on the spot and obsess over them.</li>
					<li><b><i>Joy:</i></b> Appears in glens or flowering fields, inspiring creatures to dance, relax, and sing.</li>
					<li><b><i>Love:</i></b> Appears along beaches or orchards and encourages creatures to confess their love to others and endlessly list their favorite thing.</li>
					<li><b><i>Sorrow:</i></b> Appears in ruins and swamps, particularly around quicksand, and overwhelms creatures with sobbing and confessions of regret.</li>

					Enchanted springs brim with miraculous waters, whether they tap into magical sources hidden beneath the earth or they're blessed by eldritch beings. Those who find these mystical sites might
					bathe or drink from the pools and temporarily gain a measure of the waters' magic. All manner of protectors or covetous guardians might lurk around these springs, driving off strangers or
					demanding a worthy price for access to the mystical waters.
				</p>
				<p>
					While many enchanted springs bear the blessings of wild gods or fey beings, some are tainted. These might be waters that were long ago polluted by the ichor of an evil entity. As with pristine
					enchanted springs, folk seek out such defiled places, whether to purify them or claim their foul powers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regardless of whether a spring is pure or tainted, creatures might need to drink the water to experience the spring's effects, simply touch the water, or bathe in it for a minute to trigger an
					effect. Bottling an enchanted spring's water removes its magical properties, unless the bottle is a specially prepared vial blessed by whatever being enchanted the spring in the first place.

					Mushrooms can be deadly, delicious, or both. Some have magical properties, especially those that grow in areas suffused by mystical energy, such as the Underdark and the Feywild. Creatures
					proficient in the Medicine, Nature, or Survival skills might be versed on the subject of fungi, especially the magical kind, since the beneficial effects can save lives or bestow unusual powers.
					But when an unknown variety of fungus is encountered, only an expert can identify it and determine its properties. To determine the effects of eating such fungus, roll on the Magic Mushroom
					Effects table.

					<h4>Mimic Colonies</h4>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Mimics imitate terrain and dungeon dressing to hunt for food. Rare specimens develop a deeper un￾derstanding of the world and can communicate with other creatures. In extremely rare cases,
					groups of these creatures band together, creating colonies. These bonded mimics cooperate to create larger objects than any lone mimic could approximate. A mimic colony can work together to form
					buildings, bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, and nearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearing out of nowhere might be composed of mimics! Members of a mimic colony
					develop telepathy and the ability to speak. While within 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can communicate telepathically with other creatures within 120 feet of it and can speak Common and
					Undercommon fluently (or two other languages of the DM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abilities innately and can use them even away from the colony.
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>
					A mimic colony's primary goal is survival: If threatened by a force the mimics can't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimic colonies have learned that adventurers they can't defeat can be
					bought off with information about nearby creatures or locations, hidden treasure (which the colony obtained from prior "food"), or even one of their own young. If the colony's survival is
					threatened and it thinks it has a chance of surviving a fight, it can leverage its combined might using special lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the mimic colony takes a
					lair action, causing one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC15 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until initiative count 20 on the
						following round, as pieces of the environment grasp the target. If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it is restrained instead for that duration.</li>
					<li>The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding a creature of its choice within 300 feet of it.</li>
					<li>The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in the
						environment and launch caustic spittle.</li>
					<li>The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical, inanimate material in physical contact with it. The cube can be up to 15 feet on a side. The colony reshapes that material however it likes.
						This transformation lasts for 1 hour. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>When determining the difficulty of an encounter with a hostile mimic colony, consider the colony to be one additional creature of challenge rating 2.</p>

					In wild places brimming with nature's power, gardens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants can sometimes produce fruit bursting with
					primal magic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds this stored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs: their colors are more vibrant or shift randomly, their skin sparkles in the light or
					glows in the dark, soft hums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar to the touch.
				</p>
				<p>
					A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magic might produce 1d6 pieces of primal fruit every week. Primal fruit remains potent for 1 week, after which it loses its magical properties but
					remains edible. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primal fruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezed into juice or cooked into a dish and retains its magic. Choose an effect or roll on the
					Primal Fruit Effects table to determine what happens when a piece of the fruit is consumed. An <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=Identify"><i>Identify</i></a> spell or similar magic reveals the
					beneficial effect of a piece of fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curse or side effect.

					Currents of magic run through the world—invisible, artery-like networks that exert subtle influence and connect disparate lands. The greatest of these magical streams are persistent paths, often
					known by colloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. An unearthly road acts like a sort of planar portal that stretches from one place to another, be they sites on the same world or on
					different planes of existence. Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great distances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to an exit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like long tunnels,
					and a creature that travels on an unearthly road progresses 21 miles of distance in the time it would normally take it to travel 1 mile. While on the road, glimpses of the world beyond might be
					visible in blurred or distorted visions of scenery or especially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specific details are not visible beyond an unearthly road. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or secret connections between distant lands. Others shift locations at noteworthy times or in response to external phenomena, like on specific
					anniversaries or in response to the phases of the moon. Some might also require a particular item, ritual, or action to open their gates. The Unearthly Road Keys table offers suggestions on how
					to enter an unearthly road.
