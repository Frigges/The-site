					<h2>Aboleth</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm,
					making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have flawless memories.
					They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds. Aboleths' minds are treasure
					troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding
					worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use their telepathic
					powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its
					lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of
					Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months. Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to
					prepare their plans for perfect execution.
				</p>
				<h4 id="abolethlair">An Aboleth's Lair</h4>
				<p>
					Aboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the
					creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.</li>
					<li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.</li>
					<li>As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature
						charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible,
						it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it
						disappears.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.

			<details id="angel">
				<summary>
					<h2>Angels</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further its god's agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are
					destroyers too, and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.<br>
					Angels are formed from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of great power and foresight. Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even chaotic good
					deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands. An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity.
					However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the path of law and good. An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost
					never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel
					never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most
					dire circumstances.
				</p>
				<h4>Deva</h4>
				<p>Devas are angels that act as divine messengers or agents to the Material Plane, the Shadowfell, and the Feywild and that can assume a form appropriate to the realm they are sent to. Legend tells of
					angels that take mortal form for years, lending aid, hope, and courage to good hearted folk. A deva can take any shape, although it prefers to appear to mortals as an innocuous humanoid or animal.
					When circumstances require that it cast off its guise, a deva is a beautiful humanoid-like creature with silvery skin. Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl
					from its shoulder blades.</p>
				<h4>Planetar</h4>
				<p>Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, presenting a tangible representation of their deities' might. A planetar can call down rain to relieve a drought, or can loose an insect plague to
					devour crops. A planetar's celestial ears detect every falsehood, and its radiant eyes see through every deception. Planetars are muscular and hairless and have opalescent green skin and
					white-feathered wings. They tower over most humanoids, brandishing immense swords with grace. Sometimes sent to aid powerful mortals on important tasks for good, planetars are especially fond of
					missions that involve battling fiends.</p>
				<h4>Solar</h4>
				<p>A solar is godlike in its glory and power. On the battlefield, the solar's sword flies into the fray on its own, and a single arrow from a solar's bow can strike a target dead on contact. So great is a
					solar's celestial might that even demon princes shrink at its resonant commands. It is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that are known are stewards of specific deities. The
					others rest in a state of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good.</p>
				<h4>Valkyria</h4>
				<p>
					Valkyriae serve as messengers of good gods of battle, and as psychopomps for the souls of those who died noble deaths in battle. They resemble beautiful women with two feathered wings. Rarely, a
					valkyria might be sent down to assist a champion or even lead a favoured kings troops into battle, especially if that battle is against the forces of evil. Valkyriae fighting alongside a champion
					often fall in love with their charge and plead with their god to extend their stay. More powerful valkyriae are known as shield-goddesses, and appear only alongside their god or that god's
					greatest heroes.
				</p>
				<h4>Fallen Angels</h4>
				<p>
					An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to
					commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the
					deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among
					other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Others still seek refuge on the material plane, where they pose as benevolent gods, coaxing mortals into fanatical and binding servitude even
					beyond death.<br>
					Secretly, fallen angels feel vulnerable and alone without their divine conenction, commiting evil acts out of jealousy and fear. In rare cases, a fallen angel can be convinced to return to the
					side of good and, in time, redeem themselves. A redeemed angel is usually forgiven and taken back by their deity, but some remain independent, content to be doing good regardless of their lack of
					a divine connection.

				<summary>
					<h2>Assassin Vine</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					An assassin vine is an ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It usually stays put unless it needs to seek out
					prey. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch from the main vine every 6 inches. In late summer, the secondary vines produce bunches of
					small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor. An assassin vine usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other
					fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it. 
				</p>

			<details id="awakenedplants">
				<summary>
					<h2>Awakened Plants</h2>
				</summary>
			<p>An awakened plant is an ordinary plant given sentience and mobility by the <i>Awaken</i> spell or similar magic.</p>
			</details>
		</div>
		<div id="b">
			<details> <!--beasts-->
				<summary>
					<h2>Beasts</h2>
					<p>A huge variety of beasts live thoughout the worlds of DnD. Sometimes, a beast you're looking for has no statblock. In such cases, an approximation is almost always good enough; For instance,
						the statblock of an Ostrich works just as well for an Emu.
					</p>
				</summary>
				<h4 id="almiraj">Almiraj</h4>
				<p>
					An almiraj is a large, timid rabbit with a 1-foot-long spiral horn emerging from its forehead, not unlike the horn of a unicorn. If driven to attack, it tries to spear enemies with its horn.
					They live in earthen burrows and are skilled at evading predators, but can be captured and domesticated.
				</p>
			<h4 id="amphisbaena">Amphisbaena</h4>
			<p>The amphisbaena has a head at either end of its serpentine body, and each head sports venomous fangs. To move, an amphisbaena uses one mouth to grip the neck of its other head, forming a hoop that
				rolls over the ground.</p>
			<h4 id="aurochs">Aurochs</h4>
			<p>Bahgtru, son of Gruumsh and Luthic, is the orc deity of unbridled strength. Legend says Bahgtru needed a mount as fierce as him for making war, so he sought a mighty aurochs, subjugated the creature
				with his bare hands, and hauled it to Nishrek, Gruumsh's realm. Bahgtru named the beast Kazaht, or "Bull" in Orc. On Kazaht's bare back, Bahgtru charges into battle, ramming into an enemy host and
				leaping over the aurochs's horns to land in the midst of his foes. Ores that revere Bahgtru might tend a stable of war bulls that carry them into combat. Trained to be fierce mounts from a young age,
				aurochs are sacred symbols of Bahgtru. No orc will eat such creatures, which are treated as honored warriors when they perish.</p>
			<h4 id="bloodhawk">Blood Hawk</h4>
			<p>Taking its name from its crimson feathers and aggressive nature, the blood hawk fearlessly attacks almost any animal, stabbing it with its dagger like beak. Blood hawks flock together in large numbers,
				attacking as a pack to take down prey</p>
			<h4 id="cattle">Cattle</h4>
			<p>There are many kinds of cattle, from common cows and oxen to more unusual, magical variants.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An <b>Ox</b> is mainly used for draft work rather than meat or milk.</li>
				<li>Ordinary <b>Rothé</b> resemble musk oxen. <b>Deep rothé</b> are stunted Underdark variants of rothe. They communicate with each other by using magical flashing lights.</li>
				<li><b>Stench Kows</b> are orange and green misshapen bison native to the Lower Planes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="cragcat">Crag Cat</h4>
			<p>A crag cat is a sure-footed predator that can be found anywhere except deep forest, preferring ledges and cliffs in the mountains. Its cry resembles a human scream of terror. It often elicits such
				sounds from its victims, for it prefers human flesh to all other prey. Crag cats blend in with natural surroundings. During the winter, their fur turns white to blend in with the snow. At other times
				of the year, their fur is gray, enabling them to hide among the rocks more easily. The crag cat knows its territory and often attacks when its prey is asleep, exhausted, or otherwise weakened.
				Although crag cats are typically solitary, they can be found in family groups of two parents and 1d4 Small noncombatant cubs in the spring, or in hungry packs in severe winter weather</p>
			<h4 id="deathdog">Death Dog</h4>
			<p>A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers.
				Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.</p>
			<h4 id="dolphin">Dolphin</h4>
			<p>Dolphins are clever, social marine mammals that feed on small fish and squid. An adult specimen is around 2 meters long.</p>
			<h4 id="flyingsnake">Flying Snake</h4>
			<p>A flying snake is a brightly colored, winged serpent found in remote jungles. Tribespeople and cultists sometimes domesticate flying snakes to serve as messengers that deliver scrolls wrapped in their
				coils.</p>
			<h4 id="Fox">Fox</h4>
			<p>Foxes prowl the outskirts of towns and nearby forests for food, hunting hares or stealing fish. These timid creatures avoid contact with humanoids, but are sometimes used as mounts by other tiny
				creatures.</p>
			<h4 id="gianteagle">Giant Eagle</h4>
			<p>A giant eagle is a noble creature that speaks its own language and understands speech in the Common tongue. A mated pair of giant eagles typically has up to four eggs or young in their nest</p>
			<h4 id="giantelk">Giant Elk</h4>
			<p>The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant
				elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.</p>
			<h4 id="giantfirebeetle">Giant Fire Beetle</h4>
			<p>A giant fire beetle is a nocturnal creature that takes its name from a pair of glowing glands that give off light. Miners and adventurers prize these creatures, for a giant fire beetle's glands
				continue to shed light for 1d6 days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles are most commonly found underground and in dark forests.</p>
			<h4 id="giantlizard">Giant Lizard</h4>
			<p>A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark
				dwellers.</p>
			<h4 id="giantowl">Giant Owl</h4>
			<p>Giant owls often befriend fey and other sylvan creatures and are guardians of their woodland realms.</p>
			<h4 id="giantvulture">Giant Vulture</h4>
			<p>A giant vulture has advanced intelligence and a malevolent bent. Unlike its smaller kin, it will attack a wounded creature to hasten its end. Giant vultures have been known to haunt a thirsty, starving
				creature for days to enjoy its suffering.</p>
			<h4 id="hippogriff">Hippogriff</h4>
			<p>A beast whose magical origins are lost to history, a hippogriff possesses the wings and forelimbs of an eagle, the hindquarters of a horse, and a head that combines the features of both animals. 
				Reclusive and omnivorous, hippogriffs mate for life and seldom venture more than a few miles from their nest. When defending its mate or its young, a hippogriff fights to the death. Hippogriffs
				don't lay eggs but give birth to live young. Dragons, griffons, and wyverns have a taste for hippogriff meat and frequently prey on these creatures.<br>
				A hippogriff raised in captivity can be trained to be a faithful companion and mount. Of all the creatures that can serve as flying mounts, hippogriffs are among the easiest to train and the most
				loyal once trained properly.</p>
			<h4 id="hulkingcrab">Hulking Crab</h4>
			<p>Much bigger than a giant crab, a hulking crab has a body 6-7 meters in diameter. Its shell is often covered with coral, anemones, ship wreckage, or some other sort of detritus salvaged from the
				ocean floor.</p>
			<h4 id="knuckleheadtrout">Knucklehead Trout</h4>
			<p>The tasty and tenacious knucklehead trout can't easily be caught in nets. Moreover, using a line to reel in such a strong fish is a significant undertaking. Incautious fishers who get pulled into
				freezing water can quickly die, particularly if they're weighed down by heavy furs and cloaks. A male knucklehead trout can weigh 70 pounds or more. The females tend to be smaller, weighing about
				50 pounds. Both are prized for their ivory-like bones.</p>
			<h4 id="lurker" title="grouping temnospondyls as dinosaurs doesn't sit right with me when they have a potential niche that isn't really filled by any modern animal, so they go here">Lurker</h4>
			<p>Lurkers are big amphibians that fill the role of crocodiles in colder climates, thanks to their ability to hibernate. Most are smaller than crocodiles, and feed on proportional prey such as hares or
				the odd child, though the larger variants can snatch even unwary elks or adult humanoids if given the opportunity.</p>
			<p>Snapflounders are relatively small lurkers that hide at the bottoms of murky ponds and rivers, waiting for fish or other small creatures to swim past so they can quickly open their jaws and suck them
				in. They aren't agressive and do not feed on humanoids, but might bite one that swims or wades by by mistake</p>
			<h4 id="mammoth">Mammoth</h4>
			<p>A mammoth is an elephantine creature with thick fur and long tusks. Stockier and fiercer than normal elephants, mammoths inhabit a wide range of climes, from subarctic to subtropical.</p>
			<h4 id="mastiff">Mastiff</h4>
			<p>Mastiffs are impressive hounds prized by humanoids for their loyalty and keen senses, Mastiffs can be trained as guard dogs, hunting dogs, and war dogs. Halflings and other Small humanoids ride them as
				mounts.</p>
			<h4 id="quipper">Quipper</h4>
			<p>A quipper is a carnivorous fish with sharp teeth. Quippers can adapt to any aquatic environment, including cold subterranean lakes. They frequently gather in swarms</p>
			<h4 id="rotgrub">Rot Grub</h4>
			<p>Rot grubs are finger-sized maggots that eat living or dead flesh, although they can survive on plant matter. They infest corpses and piles of decaying matter and attack living creatures that disturb
				them. After burrowing into the flesh of a living creature, a rot grub instinctively chews its way toward the heart in order to kill its host.</p>
			<h4 id="shark">Sharks</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A <b>giant shark</b> is 9 meters long and normally found in deep oceans. Utterly fearless, it preys on anything that crosses its path, including whales and ships.</li>
				<li>Smaller than giant sharks but larger and fiercer than reef sharks, <b>hunter sharks</b> haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully
					grown hunter shark is around 6 meters long.</li>
				<li>Smaller than giant sharks and hunter sharks, <b>reef sharks</b> inhabit shallow waters and coral reefs, gathering in small packs to hunt. A full-grown specimen measures 2-3 meters long.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="spider">Spiders</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>To snare its prey, a <b>giant spider</b> spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on
					ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.</li>
				<li>Smaller than a giant spider, a <b>giant wolf spider</b> hunts prey across open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity beneath debris.</li>
				<li>A <b>phase spider</b> possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly vanishes after attacking. Its movement on the Ethereal
					Plane before coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="stirge">Stirge</h4>
			<p>
				This horrid flying creature looks like a cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end in sharp pincers, and its long, needle-like proboscis slashes the air as it seeks its next
				meal. Stirges feed on the blood of living creatures, attaching and draining them slowly. Although they pose little danger in small numbers, packs of stirges can be a formidable threat, reattaching as
				quickly as their weakening prey can pluck them off. A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis into the flesh while using its pincer legs to latch
				on to the victim. Once the stirge has sated itself, it detaches and flies off to digest its meal.
			</p>
			<h4 id="axebeak">Terror Bird</h4>
			<p>A terror bird is a tall flightless bird with strong legs and a heavy hooked beak. Some are predators, but even those who aren't have nasty dispositions and tend to attack any unfamiliar creature that
				wanders too close.</p>
			<h4 id="tressym">Tressym</h4>
			<p>A tressym is a mischievous winged cat as big as a house cat, with a wingspan of a meter. Thought to be the results of wizardly experimentation on house cats, tressym are intelligent felines known to
				form strong friendships with humanoids, particularly rangers and wizards. Tressym get along well with others of their kind, but they rarely lair or hunt together. They peacefully ignore bats, faerie
				dragons, and the like, but they hate stirges and evil flying monsters such as manticores. They also enjoy teasing dogs. Tressym feed on small rodents, birds, and insects, stalking and pouncing on prey
				as normal cats do, but with the added advantage of flight. Tressym don't, however, attack nestlings or despoil eggs. Tressym mate with others of their kind, but they don't mate for life. A tressym can
				also mate with a normal cat, though only one out of every ten of their offspring will be a tressym; the others will be normal cats.</p>
			<h4 id="walrus">Walrus</h4>
			<p>Walruses are bulky marine mammals that favor arctic climates and communicate by grunting and roaring. A typical adult specimen weighs at least 2,000 pounds. Humans hunt them for their meat, fat, skin,
				bones, and tusks. Giant walruses are enormous, ill-tempered creatures as big as elephants. A typical adult specimen weighs at least 12,000 pounds.</p>
				<h4 id="whitestag">White Stag</h4>
				<p>
					Forests dominated by druids or other guardians of nature usually have one or more white stags roaming them. Born from the druidic magics that infuse the forest, these creatures are intelligent
					and often attack loggers or humanoid hunters not blessed by the forest's protectors. For this reason, as well as for their magnificent white fur and enormous horns, white stags are prized quarry
					for all hunters, even though killing one will more than certainly strain the relationship between the forest's guardians and the civilized folk.
				</p>

			<details><!--beasts-ish-->
				<summary>
					<h2>Beast-Adjaecent Critters</h2>
				</summary>
				<h2 id="blinkdog">Blink Dog</h2>
				<p>
					A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts
					and attack them on sight.
				</p>
				<h2 id="cockatrice">Cockatrice</h2>
				<p>
					The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts,
					flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs—things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of
					danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its
					victim slowly turns to stone from the injury. 
				</p>
				<h2 id="deathembrace">Death Embrace</h2>
				<p>
					Drifting through the dark waters of the Netherdeep, the death embrace is an ominous sight. Beneath its bell hangs a lacy, tendrilous mass that thrums with magic, surrounded by six 20-meter-long,
					barbed tentacles. The death embrace uses these tentacles to grasp and petrify its prey. Despite its foreboding name, the death embrace is not an overly aggressive creature. It prefers to bide its
					time, using creatures it has caught in its tentacles as shields to absorb attacks.
				</p>
				<h2 id="eblis">Eblis</h2>
				<p>
					Eblis are thought to be reincarnations of evil humans who were punished by gods for acts of larceny and kidnapping. These intelligent, evil cranes loom 8 feet tall and lay eggs as mundane birds
					do. They can manipulate objects with their beaks and feet.
				</p>
				<h2 id="pegasus">Pegasus</h2>
				<p>
					The white winged horses known as pegasi soar through the skies, a vision of grace and majesty. When they touch down on solid ground, they linger only for a moment, drinking from mountain springs
					and pristine lakes. Any sound or sign of another creature startles them, sending them off to fly once more among the clouds. Pegasi are highly prized as swift and reliable steeds, being faster
					and less temperamental than griffins, hippogriffs, and wyverns. However, these wild and shy creatures are as intelligent as humanoids, and so can't be traditionally broken and tamed. A pegasus
					must be persuaded to serve a good-aligned creature as a mount, but when it does so, it forges a lifelong bond with its new companion. Gods of good have also been known to send pegasi to the to
					aid champions and faithful in need. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Pegasi mate for life, build their nests in hard-to-reach locations, and give birth to live young.
				</p>
				<h2 id="slitheringbloodfin">Slithering Bloodfin</h2>
				<p>
					Covered in vicious-looking crimson spines and sleek scales, the slithering bloodfin flashes through the lightless waters of the Netherdeep. As it swims closer, its toothed maw comes into
					view—just before it unhinges its jaw, clamps down on its prey, and swallows it whole. A slithering bloodfin looks like a giant eel with a head like a shark's. It magically siphons life energy
					from swallowed prey and uses that energy to repair damage to its own body. When a bloodfin dies, its body bursts. The resulting gore is toxic, threatening to infect nearby creatures, until it is
					dissipated by currents. 
				</p>
				<h2 id="winterwolf">Winter Wolf</h2>
				<p>
					The arctic-dwelling winter wolf is as large as a dire wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves'
					deadly breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple conversations.
				</p>
				<h2 id="worg">Worg</h2>
				<p>
					A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and
					hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak
					Common as well
				</p>
			</details>
			<details id="blight">
				<summary>
					<h2>Blights</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Awakened plants gifted with the powers of intelligence and mobility, blights plague lands contaminated by darkness. Drinking that darkness from the soil, a blight carries out the will of ancient
					evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can. Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was
					undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the
					wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire's evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this
					Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.

					Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or power, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to
					other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time,
					an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption. In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly
					spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days. Blights are independent
					creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree's control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor's old foes or seeking
					out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.

				<h4>Needle Blight</h4>
				<p>
					In the shadows of a forest, needle blights might be taken at a distance for shuffling, hunched humanoids. Up close, these creatures reveal themselves as horrid plants whose conifer-like needles
					grow across their bodies in quivering clumps. A needle blight lashes out with these needles or launches them as an aerial assault that can punch through armor and flesh. When needle blights
					detect a threat, they loose a pollen that the wind carries to other needle blights throughout the forest. Alerted to their foes' location, needle blights converge from all sides to drench their
					roots in blood. 
				</p>
				<h4>Tree Blight</h4>
				<p>
					A tree blight is a particularly enormous variety of blight. It looks like a dead tree or treant, 30 feet tall, with spongy wooden flesh, thorny branches, and rubbery roots that trail behind it.
					It has blood for sap and is so saturated with blood that it doesn't catch fire easily. A tree blight feeds on warmblooded prey and takes perverse delight in causing carnage. It strikes with its
					heavy branches and crushes prey to death with its roots. It can open its gaping, toothfilled mouth and bite a creature caught in its roots. The roots of a tree blight can be severed, though
					cutting them causes the blight no harm. A tree blight will often fight alongside other kinds of blights, but it hates other tree blights and will attack them given the chance. Tree blights also
					hate treants, and the feeling is mutual. 
				</p>
				<h4>Twig Blight</h4>
				<p>
					Twig blights can root in soil, which they do when living prey are scarce. While rooted, they resemble woody shrubs. When it pulls its roots free of the ground to move, a twig blight's branches
					twist together to form a humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs. Twig blights seek out campsites and watering holes, rooting there to set up ambushes for potential victims coming to drink or
					rest. Huddled together in groups, twig blights blend in with an area's natural vegetation or with piles of debris or firewood. Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly susceptible to
					fire. 
				</p>
				<h4>Vine Blight</h4>
				<p>
					Appearing as masses of slithering creepers, vine blights hide in undergrowth and wait for prey to draw near. By animating the plants a round them, vine blights entangle and hinder their foes
					before attacking. Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech. Through its connection to the evil spirit of the Gulthias tree it serves, a vine blight speaks in a fractured version of its
					dead master's voice, taunting victims or bargaining with powerful foes.

					<h2>Boggle</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Boggles are the little bogeys of fairy tales. They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the Material Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and
					bedevil folk with their mischief. A boggle is born out of feelings of loneliness, materializing in a place where the Feywild touches the world in proximity to an intelligent being that feels
					isolated or abandoned. For example, a forsaken child might unintentionally conjure a boggle and see it as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower's
					house or in the caves of a hermit. Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, passing the time at their hosts' expense. A boggle isn't above breaking dishes, hiding tools, making
					frightening sounds to startle cows and sour their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle's antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief—not mayhem—is usually its
					intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					A boggle excretes an oil from its pores and can make its oil slippery or sticky. The oil dries up and disappears an hour later. It can also create magical openings to travel short distances or to
					pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between
					the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds—enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through
					it.
				</p>
				<p>
					A boggle makes a decent servant for a strong-willed master, and wicked creatures such as fomorians and hags sometimes shelter boggles in their lairs. Warlocks who form pacts with archfey have
					also been known to command boggles, and charismatic individuals who make the right offers have enjoyed temporary alliances with these little tricksters. A bored boggle always finds some way to
					entertain itself.

				</summary>
				<p>
					Not all animate corpses shamble from their graves. Boneless are undead remains devoid of skeletons. Most rise from the bodies of those who've suffered brutal ends, such as deliberate skinning or
					crushing. Deathless malice infuses what remains, their husks flopping and slithering in pursuit of vengeance or at the whims of sinister masters. Slipping through cracks and under doors, these
					stealthy undead seek to adorn living frames once more, wrapping themselves around their victims and wringing them to death in their full-body grip. Boneless arise in a variety of forms. While the
					animate skins of specific creatures are the most common, foul spellcasters might create these horrors from the scraps of failed experiments, necromantic slurries, heaps of discarded hair,
					abattoirs, and charnel concoctions. These origins don't affect a boneless's statistics but lend it distinct forms. Whether through accident or depraved genius, some villains use one corpse to
					create two separate undead. Boneless might adorn the frames of other undead, like skeletons or zombies. The sight of a boneless peeling itself from its independently undead frame haunts the
					nightmares of many seasoned monster hunters.

				<p>
					Brackish trudges are lumbering masses of sentient fungus and vegetation that thrive in the bayou. They are living examples of the conflicting forces of life and decay existing in a harmonious
					cycle. Flowers and other plant life grow on their backs, necks, and heads. When these plants die, they decay and become the ideal habitat for fungi. The older a trudge is, the wilder and more
					varied are the plants and fungi that thrive in the tiny ecosystem on its back. While sometimes ill-tempered and territorial, brackish trudges are usually content to mind their own business. When
					trudges are roused to defend themselves or drive off rivals, their punishing tusks laced with deadly fungus spores can make short work of the unwary. Trudges are also notoriously difficult to
					slay; the energies of life and death within them allow them to survive harrowing injuries.

					<h2>Bulette</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also called a "land shark," it lives only to feed. Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack
					with no regard for superior numbers or strength. Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in
					loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.<br>
					A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what
					they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field. A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty
					miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements,
					terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain. All creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food—even other predators and bulettes.
					Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and consumption.<br>
					Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be
					extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret
					nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.

					<h2>Carrion Crawler</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting. A
					carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and
					other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion
					crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way,
					they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.<br>
					Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent
					of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion
					crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it
					can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.

					<h2>Cranium Rat</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Mind flayers create cranium rats by bombarding normal rats with psionic energy. Cranium rats are no smarter than ordinary rats and behave as such. However, if enough cranium rats come together to
					form a swarm, they merge their minds into a single intelligence with the accumulated memories of all the swarm's constituents. The rats become smarter as a result, and they retain their
					heightened intelligence for as long as the swarm persists. The swarm also awakens latent psionic abilities implanted within each cranium rat by its mind flayer creators, bestowing upon the swarm
					psionic powers similar to spells. A rat separated from the swarm becomes an ordinary cranium rat with an Intelligence of 15. It loses 1 point of Intelligence each day that it remains separated
					from the swarm. Its Intelligence can't drop below 4 and becomes 15 again if it rejoins the swarm or another one.<br>
					A single, low-intelligence cranium rat uses its natural telepathy to communicate hunger, fear, and other base emotions. A swarm of cranium rats communicating telepathically "speaks" as one
					creature often referring to itself using the collective pronouns "we" and "us."<br>
					Mind flayer colonies use cranium rats as spies. The rats invade surface communities and act as eyes and ears for the elder brain, transmitting their thoughts when they swarm and are within range
					of the elder brain's telepathy. Cranium rats occasionally spread beyond the elder brain's range of influence. Whatever these rats do is of no concern to the elder brain, and the illithids can
					always make more if they so desire.

			<details id="crawlingclaw">
				<summary>
					<h2>Crawling Claw</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Crawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.
					Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it. If a dead murderer's spirit already manifests as another undead creature,
					if the murderer is raised from death, or if the spirit has long passed on to another plane, the ritual fails. The ritual invoked to create a crawling claw works best with a hand recently severed
					from a murderer. To this end, ritualists and their servants frequent public executions to gain possession of suitable hands, or make bargains with assassins and torturers.
				</p>
				<p>
					A crawling claw can't be turned, nor can it be controlled by spells that control undead. These foul monsters are entirely bound to the will of their creator, which can concentrate on a claw in
					sight to mentally command its every action. If the crawling claw's creator doesn't command it, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability. Commands given to a crawling claw must
					be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However,
					a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree. A
					crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on,
					however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its
					undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed. Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the
					crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma. Destroying the crawling claw while it is away from the body kills the murderer. However, killing the murderer has no effect on
					the crawling claw

			<details id="crone">
				<summary>
					<h2>Crones</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Crones are women, usually disenfranchised ones, who withdraw themselves from society to study dark or forbidden magic. An unholy crossing between wizard, druid, and hag, crones deal freely with
					all kinds of unhallowed beings—fey, nature spirits, fiends etc.—in order to aquire arcane knowledge and power. Their dark dealings force crones to commit a variety of depraved acts, which make
					them feared and hated throughout most communities. Yet often they are tolerated, for crones are healers too. They are as knowledgable about medicinal herbs as any druid or alchemist, and able to
					cast healing magic should the need arise. Some communities, especially isolated ones, come to rely on their local crones for such services. Crones are usually evil, but many are neutral,
					especially around communities more accepting of them. No good women become crones though, as the rituals necessary to perform a crone's magic are too sickening for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Evil crones ask a high price for their services, but no crone works for free. Even neutral ones are always in need of sacrifices or services of some kind to further their own agenda. Sometimes
					the price demanded is a daughter, not for sacrifice, but for apprenticeship. The path to becoming a crone is arduous and lonely—save for the company of other crones. As such, many girls taken
					against their will attempt to flee the crone's clutches, only to end up severely beaten when the crone catches her. Rare are the ones who manage to actually flee. Those who don't take to the life
					are twisted by abuse or simply beaten to death before that can happen. Usually however, a woman who becomes a crone is willing, approaching their local crone for training and being accepted out of 
					shared distaste for the society they left behind, or by a shared thirst for knowledge.
				</p>
				<h4>Flying Witches</h4>
				<p>
					When a crone need to travel far, she does so by air. Every full-fledged crone has her own <i class="uncmmagit">Broom of Flying</i>, or another item with the same enchantment, such as a cauldron.
					Capricious crones may ride living beings, like pigs, goats, or even men. To do so, the crone must keep her intended flying device in her clutch for weeks, subjecting it to the same enchantments
					as she would the broom. Once enchanted, the unfortunate victim functions much like a <i class="uncmmagit">Broom of Flying</i> does. It is powerless to do anything but voice its protests as the
					crone pilots its body through the air. However, it must still be straddled to be ridden, and can attempt to resist the crone while on land, going limp only once she speaks the command word while
					straddling it. Neophytes are taught how to make their brooms at different times in their training, and don't always have one. Regardless of its nature, a crone's flying device is personal, and
					loses its magic over the course of 1d6 days after its mistress dies. The crone can only have one such device at a time, however, they can sever their connection to their old device whenever they
					want. Such an object loses its magic as though the crone had died, unless the crone took further preparations to ensure it does not. Crones sometimes keep their old brooms as backups, and might
					lend either of their brooms to other creatures if they find it necessary.
				</p>
				<h4 id="cronelair">The Coven</h4>
				<p>
					Crones often form covens, both out of a desire for safety and for the desire to share knowledge between each other. A coven typically contains less than five crones, but some have dozens of
					members. The coven is a sacred sisterhood, and the price for betraying it is steep. The land where a coven of crones makes its lair becomes twisted, marked by the perverse rituals the sorority
					engage in. Any crone coven's lair has the following effects within 1 mile:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the crones) are found in great profusion.</li>
					<li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
					<li>Small cairns appear along the route of travelers, containing anything from mysterious bones to nothing at all. These cairns might be haunted by skeletons, specters, or hostile fey or fiends.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					More powerful crones might also have the following features in the same region:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Parts of the lair's region are enchanted by the <i>Druid Grove</i> spell. How much depends on how long the coven has been there.</li>
					<li><b>Elder crones</b> know forbidden rituals to turn the sensory organs of humanoids into her own remote sensors, which are hung throughout her lair's region like macabre ornaments. These
						sensors function like the <i>Alarm</i> spell, except they can only detect intruders by sight, smell, or hearing, depending on their nature. The crone can see, hear, or smell through the
						sensors as though through her own eyes, ears, or nose, but can't use the same senses to detect her own surroundings while she does so. A sensor is a tiny magical (transmutation) object with
						10 AC and 1 HP. It is destroyed if targeted by a <i>Dispel Magic</i> spell. The crone immediately knows if a sensor is destroyed and exactly which one it was.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Crones that are part of a coven gain increased power from their association, expanding their spellcasting capabilities. Coven members can cast these additional spells while at least three of them
					are within 30 feet of each other, depending on their level. A neophyte can cast spells up to 3rd level, an ordinary crone up to 6th, and an elder up to 9th. The slots are shared between the
					entire coven, resetting each day at dawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					1st level (4 slots): <i>Alarm</i>, <i>Caustic Brew</i>, <i>Hideous Laughter</i>, <i>Identify</i><br>
					2nd level (3 slots): <i>Barkskin</i>, <i>Ray of Enfeeblement</i>, <i>See Invisibility</i>, <i>Suggestion</i>, <i>Zone of Truth</i><br>

					<h2>Cave Fisher</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filament, much like the strands of a spider's webbing, which the
					creature uses to snag prey. A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is fond of bats, so it stretches its filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a
					hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a
					large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim
					its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers
					occasionally moving through the area. A cave fisher instinctively knows that larger targets such as humanoids are more difficult to overcome, so the creatures shy away from attacking such prey
					unless they come across a solitary target. They might try to pick off a scout moving ahead of a group of travelers or a straggler lagging behind, rather than attracting the attention of the
					entire group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwarven spirits include cave fisher blood as
					part of the recipe, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. If they are gathered after being extruded, cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough,
					and nearly invisible. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine. The creature's shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry.
				</p>
				<p>
					While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them for their filaments and their blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since
					their blood is flammable. As such, chitines and hobgoblins sometimes use the threat of fire to train cave fishers then employ them to guard passages or as beasts of ~ar.

			<details id="chitine">
				<summary><h2>Chitines</h2></summary>
				<p>
					Chitines are multiarmed humanoids with arachnid qualities that serve Lolth. They operate in well-organized colonies that prove to be effective fighters in the war against the enemies of the Demon
					Queen of Spiders. On occasion, Lolth pits chitines against dark elves—even though both groups worship her—as a way of punishing the drow, who created the chitines but displeased their goddess by
					doing so. Long ago, the drow first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures with both humanoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed
					chitines. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the goddess found this
					arrangement unacceptable. The creation process required cooperation between magical disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used arcane magic and demonic powers, and drow priestesses invoked
					Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting at some part of the process to see these new abominations dedicated to her, but no such riual
					was performed. In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen twisted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own purposes. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="choldrith">Choldriths</h4>
				<p>
					As the drow continued to perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occasionally, though, the elf changed into a
					monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider form, and more cunning than a chitine, that the drow dubbed a choldrith. At first, the drow were unaware that the new
					creatures were signs of Lolth's displeasure with them. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the
					chitines in their work. But the dark elves came to realize their mistake—choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and
					their enmity of the drow, and the seeds of a rebellion took root and grew. The chitines and choldriths rose up against their would-be masters; soon afterward most of the creatures were free, and
					a number of the drow who helped breed and tend them were dead. Nowadays, drow still create chitines when they have need to. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers for the
					drow, and they can be useful if the drow find an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the drow destroy the creature
					immediately. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Choldriths are born with a fanatical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some skill in divine magic. They preach that chitines are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the
					Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to free the chitines from slavery. Choldriths also believe and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a choldrith, is her truest
					shape. Any idol to Lolth in a chitine colony depicts Lolth in this way. As servants of Lolth, choldriths and chitines love spiders and spiderlike creatures. They rear spiders and similar
					arachnids, such as cave fishers. Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony
					quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chitines and choldriths resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. Chitines are divided into worker and warrior castes, and choldriths occupy the top levels of a
					colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all chitines are expected to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the choldriths.
					Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect the colony. A warrior might be responsible
					for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig a pit trap and cover it with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as
					a solid surface. A colony can support numerous choldriths, which serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one
					another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign that determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether she or any other choldrith
					is permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receives a vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire course of action. At such times, chitines have emerged from the Underdark to
					settle in remote, gloomy places on the surface, from where they can wage war on other species, especially drow and elves.

					the heads scatter and plant themselves in unholy ground. A new death's head tree emerges from each planted head 1d12 months later.

					<h2>Deathlock</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasion—at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock
					who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave. An
					extraordinarily powerful necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock's patron. 
				</p>
				<p>
					An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don't please its patron fall away as its master's desires become the
					purpose that drives the deathlock. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron's behalf Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock is forced to serve another powerful
					creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own. Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron's interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock
					in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call
					forth a horrifying entity into the world.

					<h2>Demons</h2>
					<p>
						Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the embodiment of chaos and evil—engines of destruction barely contained in monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or
						mercy, they exist only to destroy. The Abyss creates demons as extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others
						represent uniform strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes or abyssal wretches) are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which are
						otherwise trapped in the Abyss.

				<p>
					Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad categories of power known as types. Most demons fit into one of six major types, with the weakest categorized as Type 1 and
					the strongest as Type 6. Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor demons and demon lords.
				</p>
				<p>
					Demons respect power and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its commands. A demon's status grows
					with the blood it spills; the more enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes. A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually transform to a vrock after untold time
					spent fighting and surviving in the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those that do survive make up the
					ranks of the demon lords that threaten to tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring. By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser demons into greater forms, though
					such promotions never stem from a demon's deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of dretches into hezrous
					when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.<br>
					Wherever they wander across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their dark influence across the
					multiverse, undoing the works of the gods, tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and ruin. Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the
					destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off
					abyssal breaches before these fiends can break free.<br>
					Demons carry the stain of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal breaches and demons appear. Animals
					shun the sites where a demon has made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by permanent shadows
					that mark the places where these fiends lingered.<br>
					Outside the Abyss, death is a minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can't stop these fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent spells. When a lucky hero
					manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend dissolves into foul ichor. It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed. The only way to truly
					destroy a demon is to seek it in the Abyss and kill it there.<br>
					A powerful demon can take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is ceded. If the demon's abyssal form is
					ever destroyed, the amulet allows the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing. Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply seeking such a device risks drawing the
					attention of the demon that created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from the demon whose life essence the amulet holds or inflict great pain if the fiend resists. If
					an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.
				</p>
				<h4>Summoning and Demonic Possession</h4>
				<p>
					Few acts are as dangerous as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the Material Plane, they show no
					gratitude when brought there, raging against their prisons and demanding release. Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest information from it, press it into service, or send
					it on a mission that only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can force a demon to bend to
					another's will. If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.<br>
					Though demons all have common names, every demon lord and every demon of type 1 through 6 has a true name that it keeps secret. A demon can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and
					ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of the most powerful demons. A mortal who learns a demon's true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the demon from
					the Abyss and exercise some measure of control over it. However, most demons brought to the Material Plane in this manner do everything in their power to wreak havoc or sow discord and strife.<br>
					Despite the dark risks involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal servants into performing ever
					greater acts of depravity, furthering the demon lord's ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then discard at its
					whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.<br>
					The <i class="artimagit">Book of Vile Darkness</i>, the <i class="artimagit">Black Scrolls of Ahm</i>, and the <i class="artimagit">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</i> are the foremost authorities on
					demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane, placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the
					fiend's return to the Abyss. An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling and fouling the air around
					it. A creature that handles such an object experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying the object
					frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its binder.<br>
					No matter how secure its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can possess a mortal host. Sometimes
					a fiend employs stealth to hide a successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its fiendish drives through its new form. As long as the demon remains in possession of its
					host, the soul of that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon possesses a creature and the object
					binding the demon is destroyed, the possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic spirit out of its host.
				</p>
				<h4>Demon Lords</h4>
				<p>
					The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark blessing, transforming them into unique fiends whose power can rival the gods. These demon lords
					rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss. Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons
					rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss
					for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.<br>
					The greatest sign of a demon lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, and
					demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it. As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the
					Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent
					such a fate.
				</p>
				<h2>Demons in Alphabetical Order</h2>
				<h4 id="alkilith">Alkilith</h4>
				<p>
					An alkilith is easily mistaken for some kind of foul fungal growth that appears on doorways, windows, and other portals. These dripping infestations conceal the demonic nature of the alkilith,
					making what should be a dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portal through which even nastier demons
					can invade. The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can
					take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to
					that plane (see "Planar Portals" in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).<br>
					Alkiliths spring from the cast-off bits of Juiblex's hideous, shuddering body, then gradually become self-aware and set out to find their way onto the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider
					them too risky for summoning—they can, after all, create portals to the Abyss—alkiliths must find other escape routes out of their native plane.</p>
				<h4 id="armanite">Armanite</h4>
				<p>
					Great herds of armanites race across the blasted fields of the Abyss, bent on slaughter and death, driven by unrestrained bloodlust. Whether being controlled by more powerful demons or charging
					into battle for the sake of it, armanites use their claws, hooves, and long, whiplike tails to tear apart their foes. In the armies of the demon lords, armanites perform the role of heavy
					cavalry, leading the charge and tearing into their enemies' flanks. Armanites fight all the time, even among themselves if they can't find another enemy. They make ideal shock troops, courageous
					to the point of stupidity and utterly savage. Part of what makes armanites so fearsome is the number of weapons they have at their disposal. They possess sharp hooves, claws that end in curling
					talons, and long, serrated tails that can flense the flesh from a victim, and they use them all to carve through their foes . When they are up against tough formations, they can call on their
					innate magic to loose bolts of lightning and blow holes in the enemy ranks.
				</p>
				<h4 id="babau">Babau</h4>
				<p>
					Demons and devils clash endlessly for control of the Lower Planes. One of these battles pitted the legions of the archdevil Glasya against the screaming hordes of the demon lord Graz'zt. It is
					said that Glasya wounded Graz'zt with her sword, and the first babaus arose where his blood struck the ground. Their sudden appearance helped rout Glasya and secured Graz'zt's place as one of the
					preeminent demon lords of the Abyss. A babau demon possesses the cunning of a devil and the bloodthirstiness of a demon. It has leathery black skin pulled tight over its gaunt frame, and a curved
					horn protruding from the back of its elongated skull. A babau's baleful glare can weaken a creature.
				</p>
				<h4 id="balor">Balor</h4>
				<p>
					Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them. Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword
					that channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of fire that can destroy
					even the hardiest foes.
				</p>
				<h4 id="barlgura">Barlgura</h4>
				<p>
					The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory
					with such objects. A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs
					650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.
				</p>
				<h4 id="bulezau">Bulezau</h4>
				<p>
					Diseased manifestations of animalistic rage, bulezaus embody the violence of nature. Across the Abyss, bulezaus lurk in deep canyons and lofty crags, and many find a place in the ranks of the
					demon lords' armies, serving as foot soldiers in the Abyss's endless warring. Bulezaus crave violence. Their eagerness to kill and willingness to die make them common members of any demon lord's
					entourage. When not being corralled by larger and tougher demons, bulezaus gather into scrabbling mobs, wrestling and fighting among themselves until a better target comes a long or until a
					stronger demon bullies them into subservience. Disfiguring ailments plague bulezaus: crusted eyes, maggots wriggling in open sores, and a reek of rotten meat that follows them wherever they go.
				</p>
				<h4 id="chasme">Chasme</h4>
				<p>
					This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable crossing of humanoid and fly. A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the
					approach of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack. The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to
					dole out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of
					reprisal.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dretch">Dretch</h4>
				<p>
					Dretches are among the weakest of demons—repulsive, self-loathing creatures doomed to spend eternity in a state of perpetual discontent. Their low intelligence makes dretches unsuitable for
					anything but the simplest tasks. However, what they lack in potential, they make up for in sheer malice. Dretches mill about in mobs, voicing their displeasure as an unsettling din of hoots,
					snarls, and grunts.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dybbuk">Dybbuk</h4>
				<p>
					Dybbuks terrorize mortals on the Material Plane by possessing corpses and giving them a semblance of life, after which the demons use them to engage in a range of sordid activities. In their
					natural form, dybbuks appear as translucent flying jellyfish, trailing long tendrils as they move through the air. They rarely travel in this fashion, however. Instead, a dybbuk possesses the
					first suitable corpse it finds, rousing the body from death so it can then indulge its hideous vices. By plundering a corpse's memories and accessing its capabilities, a dybbuk can impersonate
					the creature as it was in life. But the truth of the matter quickly becomes apparent to those around it, because a dybbuk can't resist pursuing its vices with a maniacal single-mindedness that
					betrays its true nature. Dybbuks delight in terrorizing other creatures by making their host bodies behave in horrifying ways—throwing up gouts of blood, excreting piles of squirming maggots, and
					contorting their limbs in impossible ways as they scuttle across the ground.
				</p>
				<h4 id="glabrezu">Glabrezu</h4>
				<p>
					A glabrezu takes great pleasure in destroying mortals through temptation, and these creatures are among the few demons to offer their service to creatures foolish enough to summon them. Although
					glabrezus are devastating in combat, they prefer to tempt victims into ruin, using power or wealth as a lure. Engaging in guile, trickery, and evil bargains, a glabrezu hoards riches that it uses
					to fulfill promises to shortsighted summoners and weak-willed mortals. However, if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a glabrezu has the strength to fight and win.
				</p>
				<h4 id="goristro">Goristro</h4>
				<p>
					The goristro resembles a fiendish minotaur towering more than twenty feet tall. When controlled by a demon lord, goristros make formidable living siege engines and prized pets. Goristros possess
					preternatural cunning when navigating labyrinthine passages and shifting corridors, pursuing foes in a terrifying hunt. A hulking goristro sometimes bears a palanquin, carrying smaller demons on
					its broad shoulders, much like an elephant carries riders on its back.
				</p>
				<h4 id="hezrou">Hezrou</h4>
				<p>
					Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demonic hordes of the Abyss. Although physically powerful, they are weakminded and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful
					demons. As they press their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their foul stench can sicken even the toughest foes.
				</p>
				<h4 id="manes">Manes</h4>
				<p>
					Souls of evil creatures that descend to the Lower Planes are transformed into manes-the lowest form of demonkind. These wretched fiends attack any nondemon they see, and they are called to the
					Material Plane by those seeking to sow death and chaos. Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power to transform manes into undead monsters, most often ghouls and shadows. Other demon lords feed
					on manes, destroying them utterly. Otherwise, killing a manes causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that reforms into another manes after one day.
				</p>
				<h4 id="manitou">Manitou</h4>
				<p>
					A manitou is an incorporeal perverted echo of a long forgotten nature goddess who died in the abyss. The manitou appears as a horrific tangle of ghostly, thorny vines, each terminating in a jaw
					of razor-sharp woodlike teeth. When it attacks, these teeth solidify just long enough to rend and tear flesh. A manitou takes particular delight in corrupting sylvan regions and has a singular
					hunger for dryad souls.
				</p>
				<h4 id="marilith">Marilith</h4>
				<p>
					Terrible to behold, a marilith has the lower body of a great serpent and the upper torso of a humanoid female with six arms. Wielding a wicked blade in each of its six hands, a marilith is a
					devastating foe that few can match in battle. These demons possess keen minds and a finely honed sense of tactics, and they are able to lead and unite other demons in common cause. Mariliths are
					often encountered as captains at the head of a demonic horde, where they embrace any opportunity to rush headlong into battle.
				</p>
				<h4 id="maurezhi">Maurezhi</h4>
				<p>
					When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society of elves, he created a new breed of demons to lead packs of ghouls and ghasts in the material world. When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of
					a humanoid it has slain—a process that takes about 10 minutes—it instantly assumes the creature's appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days,
					eventually revealing the demon's original form. Maurezhi are contagion incarnate. Their bite attacks can drain a victim's sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the
					victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.
				</p>
				<h4 id="mawdemon">Maw Demon</h4>
				<p>
					Maw demons share Yeenoghu's ceaseless hunger for carnage and mortal flesh. After a maw demon rests for 8 hours, anything devoured by it is transported directly into the Lord of Savagery's gullet.
					Maw demons appear among gnoll war bands, usually summoned as part of ritual offerings of freshly slain humanoids made to Yeenoghu. The gnolls don't command them, but these demons accompany the
					war band and attack whatever creatures the gnolls fall upon.
				</p>
				<h4 id="molydeus">Molydeus</h4>
				<p>
					The most ruthless and dangerous of demons—more feared than the dreaded balor—the molydeus speaks with the authority of the demon lord it serves as it enforces its master's will. Standing some 12
					feet tall, a molydeus has a red-skinned, humanoid body and two heads—one that of a slavering wolf and the other that of a serpent with dripping fangs perched atop a long neck. Molydei might guard
					their masters' possessions, roam the battlefields of the Abyss to ensure the loyalty of troops, or bring swift death to their enemies.<br>
					When a demon earns the attention of a demon lord through ferocity, cunning, or an act of surprising devotion, the demon lord might reward such service by snatching up the fiend and subjecting it
					to excruciating torments to remake it into a molydeus. A demon lord has a direct link to its molydeus and uses the serpent head to communicate its wishes. A molydeus is, therefore, said to utter
					its master's will, commanding other demons to carry out orders and using violence to ensure they obey. A molydeus must constantly be ready for the scrutiny of its master, for the demon lord can
					decide at any moment to observe the molydeus through the serpent. Thus, there is no room for treachery in a molydeus.<br>
					As part of a demon lord's trust in its molydeus, it bestows a powerful weapon upon the guardian demon. The demon lord fashions the weapon from a portion of the fiend's essence, so that the demon
					and its weapon are forever bound. If the molydeus dies, the weapon dissolves into a pool of foul-smelling slime. It's possible to steal such a weapon, but a molydeus deprived of its weapon will
					stop at nothing to regain it. The weapon a molydeus wields reflects the nature of its master. Those that serve Baphomet carry a glaive; Demogorgon, a whip; Fraz-Urb'luu, a battleaxe; Graz'zt, a
					greatsword; Orcus, a morningstar; and Yeenoghu, a flail. The weapon's form doesn't affect its capabilities.<br>
					One of the chief tasks of any molydeus is to help protect its master's amulet—the most prized possession of any demon lord. Each of these dangerous relics allows a demon lord to return to life in
					the Abyss if the unthinkable occurs and its abyssal form is destroyed. As useful as these amulets are, they are also liabilities—because, armed with an amulet, a creature can coerce the demon
					lord to which it belongs into doing its bidding, or can strand it in the Abyss if the amulet is destroyed
				</p>
				<h4 id="nabassu">Nabassu</h4>
				<p>
					The insatiable nabassus prowl the multiverse in search of souls to devour. If they think they can kill a creature and consume its soul, they attack—even if that other creature is a demon,
					including another nabassu. Demons have few rules, and the murder of other demons hardly raises an eyebrow among these fiends. The act of devouring souls is something else. For this reason, most
					demons shun nabassus and force them to live on the fringes of the Abyss. There, nabassus pick off weaker demons or, if the situation warrants, gather in packs to take down larger prey. Some
					especially powerful nabassus even search for demon lords' amulets.<br>
					Whenever magic pulls demons from the Abyss to the Material Plane, nabassus try to get summoned so that they can embark on a feast of souls there. If a nabassu is summoned, it tries to break free
					so that it can devour the soul of its summoner and then set out to feed on the souls of whatever creatures it can catch. One way a summoner can avoid this fate is by providing a steady supply of
					souls to the nabassu, which can cause the demon to be cooperative—for as long as the supply lasts.
				</p>
				<h4 id="nalfeshnee">Nalfeshnee</h4>
				<p>
					The nalfeshnee is one of the most grotesque demons—a corpulent mockery of ape and boar standing twice the height of a human, with feathered wings that seem too small for its bloated body. These
					brutish features conceal a remarkable intelligence and cunning. Nalfeshnees are devastating in combat, using their wings to soar above the front ranks and reach vulnerable adversaries that can be
					dispatched with little effort from the thick of battle, they telepathically bellow commands to lesser demons, even as they inspire a sense of dread that forces their foes to scatter and run.
					Nalfeshnees feed on hatred and despair, but they crave humanoid flesh above all else. They keep their larders filled with humanoids abducted from the Material Plane, then eat those creatures alive
					during elaborate feasts. Thinking of themselves as refined and cultured, nalfeshnees employ stained and rusted cutlery when they dine.
				</p>
				<h4 id="quasit">Quasit</h4>
				<p>
					Quasits infest the Lower Planes. Physically weak, they keep to the shadows to plot mischief and wickedness. More powerful demons use quasits as spies and messengers when they aren't devouring them
					or pulling them apart to pass the time. A quasit can assume animal forms, but in its true form it looks like a 2-foot-tall green humanoid with a barbed tail and horns. The quasit has clawed fingers
					and toes, and these claws can deliver an irritating poison. It prefers to be invisible when it attacks.
				</p>
				<h4 id="rutterkin">Rutterkin</h4>
				<p>
					The rutterkins, a breed of warped demon, roam the Abyss in mobs that constantly search for intruders to surround and devour. Rutterkins protect the Abyss from non-demons. When they spot any
					interlopers, they gather in a crowd and surge forward, emitting a wave of fear in advance of their attacks that leaves their victims terrified and rooted in place. Creatures bitten by rutterkins
					are exposed to a terrible disease that infects them with the corrupting influence of the Abyss. Victims that succumb to the disease experience tremendous pain as their bodies become disfigured,
					flesh twisting around the bones, until they transform to join the mass of abyssal wretches that follow in the wake of the rutterkin mob that laid them low.
				</p>
				<h4 id="shadowdemon">Shadow Demon</h4>
				<p>
					When a demon's body is destroyed but the fiend is prevented from reforming in the Abyss, its essence sometimes takes on a vague physical form. These shadow demons exist outside the normal abyssal
					hierarchy, since their creation results most often from mortal magic, not from transformation or promotion. Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without
					making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct
					shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind.
				</p>
				<h4 id="shoosuva">Shoosuva</h4>
				<p>
					A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu to an especially powerful gnoll (typically as a fang of Yeenoghu). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a war band achieves a great victory, emerging
					from a billowing, fetid cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to
					bring down another one. A creature immobilized by the poison becomes easy pickings for any gnolls nearby. Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular gnoll and fights alongside its master. A gnoll
					that has been gifted with a shoosuva is second only to a flind in status within a war band.
				</p>
				<h4 id="sibirex">Sibirex</h4>
				<p>
					Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and
					bile cascade from a sibriex's body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the landscape becomes polluted. Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding
					knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into
					serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.<br>
					Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure
					that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater
					strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Variant: Flesh Warping</b><br>
					Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, the DM can roll percentile dice and
					consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes

				<h4 id="vrock">Vrock</h4>
				<p>
					Vrocks are dull-witted, capricious fiends that live only to create pain and carnage. A vrock resembles a giant hybrid of humanoid and vulture, its gnarled, bestial body and broad wings stinking
					of offal. Vrocks gobble humanoid flesh whenever they can, stunning potential prey with an ear-splitting shriek, then swooplng down to attack with beak and claw. Vrocks can shake their wings,
					releasing clouds of toxic spores. Coveting pretty things, vrocks turn against each other for the chance to lay claim to cheap jewelry or ornamental stones. Despite their love of treasure, vrocks
					are difficult to bribe, seeing no reason to bargain when they can simply take what they want from a would-be bargainer's corpse.

				<h4 id="wastrilith">Wastrilith</h4>
				<p>
					Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bodies of water contaminated by the plane's fell influence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty.
					A wastrilith contaminates the waters around it. Its noxious presence even affects nearby sources of water when the demon travels on land. The corrupted water, which contains a measure of the
					demon's essence, responds to its commands—perhaps hardening to prevent foes from escaping, or erupting in a surge that drags would-be victims into its reach. Creatures that ingest water that has
					been corrupted by a wastrilith risk their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous liquid might wither a way until they finally die, or remain alive only to be come a thrall of chaos and evil.
					To represent this defilement, you can use the optional rule on abyssal corruption in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, causing the poisoned creature to be corrupted.
				</p>
				<h4 id="yochlol">Yochlol</h4>
				<p>
					The yochlols are the Handmaidens of Lolth—extensions of the Spider Queen's will dedicated to acting as her spies, taskmasters, and agents of villainy. They attend their goddess in the Demonweb
					Pits, but Lolth sometimes dispatches yochlols to the Material Plane to guard her temples and to aid her most devout priestesses. Yochlols don't form outside Lolth's realm of the Demonweb, and
					they serve no demon lords except their queen. Outside the Abyss, a yochlol can assume the guise of a female drow or monstrous spider to conceal its demonic form. In its true form, the fiend
					appears as a pillar of yellow slime with a single malevolent eye. In its drow and true form, a yochlol's touch carries the same venomous touch as its spider form's bite.
				</p>
				<h2>Rakdos Demons</h2>
				<p>
					The demons of Ravnica embody depraved impulses: selfishness, cruelty, hatred, greed, and lust for power. Demons are strongly associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in fact, the demons of Ravnica
					might have been created by Rakdos in the same way that angels were created by the Boros Legion's founder. As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the
					demons of this world—even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority. Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight
					under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire
					city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.
				</p>
				<h4 id="cackler">Cackler</h4>
				<p>
					Cacklers are small, jabbering jesters that spice up Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their incessant cackling can inspire uncontrollable laughter by making everything—even the most
					horrifying spectacles—seem hilarious. Some cacklers excel at vocal mimicry and perform as impressionists; others put their sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying passersby.
					Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures.
				</p>
				<h4 id="masterofcruelties">Master of Cruelties</h4>
				<p>
					When a master of cruelties steps up as ringleader of a Rakdos show, the audience can be assured of a performance they will remember for the rest of their lives—however brief that might be. The
					mesmerizing presence of a master of cruelties draws every eye to the demon and commands an audience's full attention. With every act of depraved torment the demon performs, onlookers are drawn
					more and more into the blood lust. Audiences clamor for more violence, and those who get too caught up in the revelry feel compelled to partake in the indiscriminate killing.
				</p>
				<h4 id="sireofinsanity">Sire of Insanity</h4>
				<p>
					Rakdos nightclubs, where visitors can indulge any dark desire and revel in sadistic spectacle. are the favored haunts of the demons known as sires of insanity. Lurking in an underground vault
					beneath a Rakdos operation, a sire of insanity feasts on the violence, torment, and depravity unfolding above. Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to
					its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind. A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of
					pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows.

					<h2>Devils</h2>
					<p>
						Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the
						dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to
						corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.
					</p>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel
					punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power. Devils understand the failings that
					plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their
					influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br>
					In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on
					this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss. At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that
					eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are
					the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br>
					Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some
					benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the
					lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells. To own a creature's soul is
					to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies
					naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells
					with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.
				</p>
				<h4>The Infernal Hierarchy</h4>
				<p>
					The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser
					god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command
					legions of subordinates. A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most
					matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of
					Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes. If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil
					disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are
					destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.
					<br><b><i>Archdevils:</i></b> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses
					that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.
					<br><b><i>Greater Devils:</i></b> A greater devil is any kind of devil with a CR of 11 or higher that is not an archdevil.
					<br><b><i>Lesser Devils:</i></b> A lesser devil is any kind of devil with a CR of 10 or lower, except a lemure. 
					<br><b><i>Lemure:</i></b> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if
					it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.
					<br><b><i>Promotion and Demotion:</i></b> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the
					power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion
					invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next. Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms
					lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed
					into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br>
					Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior
					existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive. No
					devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival arch devils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to
					Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br>
					Some kinds of devils arise from specific circumstances rather than infernal promotion and thus fall outside of the normal infernal hierarchy.

				<h4>Devil True Names and Talismans</h4>
				<p>
					Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed and ancient
					scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils. A mortal who learns a devil's true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and
					bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in
					the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted. However it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service.
					However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner's soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to
					serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.
				</p>
				<h2>Devil Kinds in Alphabetical Order</h2>
				<h4 id="amnizu">Amnizu</h4>
				<p>
					Amnizus lead the infernal legions into battle and command guardians at the gateways to the Hells. Amnizus are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they're also highly intelligent tacticians and
					unfailingly loyal—qualities that the hellish archdukes value. Some amnizus perform the critical task of watching over the River Styx from fortresses along the river's blighted banks, where it
					flows through Dis and Stygia. Souls arriving in the form of lemures have no personalities or memories; they're driven only by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus that patrol here drill the
					rules of the Nine Hells into the new arrivals' pitiful brains and marshal the lemures into legions.
				</p>
				<h4 id="barbeddevil">Barbed Devil (Hamatula)</h4>
				<p>
					Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines,
					and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.
					Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls
					of flame at foes that try to flee them.
				</p>
				<h4 id="beardeddevil">Bearded Devil (Barbazu)</h4>
				<p>
					Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves
					on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes. A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skln, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its
					fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.
				</p>
				<h4 id="bonedevil">Bone Devil (Osyluth)</h4>
				<p>
					Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the
					same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so. A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin
					stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in
					combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails.
				</p>
				<h4 id="chaindevil">Chain Devil (Kyton)</h4>
				<p>
					This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby,
					which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies. Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They
					are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.
				</p>
				<h4 id="erinyes">Erinyes</h4>
				<p>
					The most beautiful and striking of all lesser and greater devils, the erinyes are fierce and disciplined warriors. Sweeping down from the skies, they bring swift death to creatures that hav
					wronged their masters or defied the edicts of Asmodeus. The erinyes appear as male or female humanoids with statuesque builds and large feathery wings. Most wear stylized armor and horned helms,
					and carry exquisite swords and bows. A few also use <i class="raremagit">Ropes of Entanglement</i> to ensnare powerful foes. Legends tell that the first erinyes were angels that fell from the
					Upper Planes because of temptation or misdeed. Erinyes are always willing to take advantage of being mistaken for celestials in their missions of conquest and corruption.
				</p>
				<h4 id="horneddevil">Horned Devil (Malebranche)</h4>
				<p>
					Horned devils are lazy to the point of belligerence and reluctant to put themselves in harm's way. Moreover, they hate and fear any creature stronger than themselves. When they are sufficiently
					provoked or antagonized, the fury of these fiends can be terrifying. A malebranche stands as tall as an ogre and is sheathed in scales as tough as iron. The flying infantry of the hellish
					legions, horned devils follow orders to the letter. Their huge wings and sweeping horns create an intimidating presence as they drop from the sky and strike with deadly forks and lashing tails.
				</p>
				<h4 id="icedevil">Ice Devil (Gelugon)</h4>
				<p>
					Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and
					resentment. Coveting the power of their pit fiend superiors, ice devils work ceaselessly toward promotion, slaughtering the enemies of the Nine Hells and claiming as many souls as they can for
					their archdevil masters. Resembling a giant bipedal insect, an ice devil has clawed hands and feet, powerful mandibles, and a long tail covered in razor-sharp spikes. They also carry barbed
					spears whose icy touch can render a foe all but helpless in combat.
				</p>
				<h4 id="imp">Imp</h4>
				<p>
					Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals. An imp will proudly serve an evil master of
					any kind, but it can't be relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency. An imp can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid
					with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with its poison stinger.
				</p>
				<p>
					Imps can sometimes be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the imp
					might ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened.
				</p>
				<h4 id="lemure">Lemure</h4>
				<p>
					A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil and banished to the Nine Hells for eternity. The lowest type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures doomed to suffer torment
					until they are promoted to a higher form of devil, most commonly an imp. A lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent expression of anguish twists
					across its face, its feeble mouth babbling even though it can't speak.
				</p>
				<h4 id="merregon">Merregon</h4>
				<p>
					The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards who served evil without reservation often find everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. These faceless foot soldiers are the
					hells' legionnaires, tasked with protecting the realm and its rulers against intruders.<br>
					Merregons have no individuality, and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer's
					identity that matter: its commander and the layer of the Nine Hells it serves. Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils' protective retinues. They shrink
					from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they retreat from no fight.
				</p>
				<h4 id="narzugon">Narzugon</h4>
				<p>
					Paladins who make deals with devils and carry their twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells, who want unquestioning champions to lead
					their legions in war. These narzugons, wielding lances of hellfire and riding nightmare steeds like horrific perversions of knights errant, roam across the infernal layers and other planes to
					carry out the will of their masters.<br>
					A narzugon's lances are forged in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of
					both the narzugon and its master. Each narzugon also claims a nightmare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by <i class="lgndmagit">Infernal Tack</i> and must respond to summons and commands
					from the wearer of the spurs.
				</p>
				<h4 id="nupperibo">Nupperibo</h4>
				<p>
					No soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly worthless—those whose evil acts in life arose from carelessness and sloth more than anything else—are suitable only to become nupperibos.
					These pitiful creatures shuffle mindlessly across the landscape: blind, bloated from unquenchable hunger, and groping for whatever scraps of fetid matter or swarming vermin they can scoop into
					their groaning mouths. Individually, nupperibos are pathetic, but they're rarely alone and can be dangerous when gathered into packs. They herd together into throngs that can clog a vital passage
					or an entire valley. Clouds of stinging insects, stirges, and other vermin surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that torments any non-devil that draws near.<br>
					A nupperibo knows nothing but the hunger that propels it on a blind quest for anything to devour. Once it senses a potential meal, it pursues that prey tirelessly until the food is consumed, the
					nupperibo is slain, or some other morsel crosses the fiend's path and distracts it. With no interest of its own beyond the need to consume, a nupperibo unthinkingly obeys any command it receives
					telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general's status.
				</p>
				<h4 id="orthon">Orthon</h4>
				<p>
					When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. Orthons are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in
					their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse. Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until
					the orthon strikes. The orthon's invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.<br>
					Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but if it has no immediate assignment, an orthon might
					work for anyone who offers it the promise of a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.
				</p>
				<h4 id="pitfiend">Pit Fiend</h4>
				<p>
					The undisputed lords of most other devils, pit fiends attend the archdukes and archduchesses of the Nine Hells and carry out their wishes. These mighty devils are the generals of the Nine Hells,
					leading its infernal legions into battle. With an inflated sense of superiority and entitlement, pit fiends form a grotesque aristocracy in the infernal realm. These domineering and manipulative
					tyrants conspire to eliminate anything that stands between them and their desires, even as they negotiate the convoluted and dangerous politics of the Nine Hells. A pit fiend is a hulking monster
					with a whip-like tail and enormous wings that it wraps around itself like a cloak. Armored scales cover its body, and its fanged maw drips a venom that can lay the mightiest mortal creatures low.
					Fearless in battle, a pit fiend takes on the most powerful foes in single combat, demonstrating its supremacy and an arrogance that prevents it from acknowledging any chance of defeat.
				</p>
				<h4 id="spineddevil">Spined Devil (Spinagon)</h4>
				<p>
					Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even fiends that despise a spined
					devil's weakness treat it with a modicum of respect. A spined devil's body and tail bristle with spines, and it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines burst into flame on impact.
					When not delivering messages or gathering intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness by mobbing together to overwhelm
					their foes. Though they crave promotion and power, spined devils are craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight goes against them.

					<h4><i>My Dinosaur ecosystem isn't complete!? Plz help!?</i></h4>

						When filling a world up with dinosaurs, those who don't know much might wonder what might live alongside dinosaurs, whereas those who do know a lot might be qustioning where some dinos are.
					</p>
					<p><b><i>What lives here except dinosaurs?</i></b><br>
						An excellent question, the answer to which might surprise you. For starters, any reptile—such as a lizard or crocodile—is never gonna be out of place in a dinosaur setting. All bugs also
						make fine additions to your world. For the surprising part, any and all birds are more than suitable. Birds are dinosaurs, and forms we would recognize today had already evolved by 130
						million years ago. Furthermore, now we know a lot of dinosaurs had feathers, so even that part doesn't look out of place. Lastly dinosaurs lived alongside a huge variety of small and
						primitive mammals, which you can easily approximate with creatures like Rats, Badgers, and Weasels. If you're looking for marine animals there is already quite a few critters that show up
						when you search for dinosaurs, but aside from those your ocean should probably also have sharks. Beyond that, anything that's not a whale or seal and lives in the ocean should pretty much fit

				</div>
			  <p>As a casual dinosaur enthusiast I am obligated to point out that not all of these creatures are actual dinosaurs. However, this layman's grouping is helpful as it lets people easily search for
				"extinct weird animal" and I have thus decided to use it regardless of scientific inaccuracies. I've pointed out what creatures aren't technically dinosaurs with an asterisk. I have also grouped
				them into categories that a normal user would be more familiar with.</p>
			<h4 id="thyreophora">Armored Dinosaurs</h4>
			<p>Armored dinosaurs are heavy-set herbivorous dinosaurs with weapons on their tails. Some are armored and some are not, but all of them are very irritable and will swing their tail at whatever they don't like until the subject of their ire is dead and/or gone.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The heavy-set <b>Ankylosaurus</b> has thick bony armor all over its body. It grows to a length of 9 meters and weighs around 4 tons.</li>
				<li title="this was supposed to be stegouros, but that name cause confusion. antarctopelta is actually significantly larger than this but is otherwise the same so its name will do as a substitute"><b>Antarctopelta</b> is a boar-sized cousin of the colossal ankylosaurus. Rather than a maul, its tail is armed in a way resembling a mesoamerican war club.</li>
				<li><b>Desmatosuchus*</b> is a herbivorous, alligator-sized, crocodile relative found in the same places as dinosaurs. It lacks the tail armaments of its dinosaur bretheren, but its tail can still deliver an unpleasant whack if necessary.</li>
				<li>Prickly in more than one sense of the word, <b>Kentrosaurus</b> is a horse-sized cousin of stegosaurus. Its spines provide ample protection from most predators larger than it.</li>
				<li><b>Stegosaurus</b> is as long as Ankylosaurus but unarmored and much lighter, weighing only around half as much. It flushes the plates on its back with blood to show that it's agitated.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="ornithopod">Duck-Bills</h4>
			<p>Duck-bills and their close relatives are narrow-bodied efficient grazers, filling roles similar to cows or horses in dinosaur-dominated ecosystems. Most live in herds, and thus make excellent
				candidates for domestication wherever applicable. While larger duck-bills habitually walk on all fours, they will run on only their back legs and can rear up if the want to reach for higher
				vegetation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Dryosaurus</b> is a shy and relatively small duck-bill relative about the size of a big human man. It inhabits warm and temperate forests, relying on its speed and camouflage to avoid predators.</li>
				<li title="the scale of this is actually based on Shantungosaurus, but Edmontosaurus is pretty close in size and has a better name">The enormous <b>Edmontosaurus</b> is the largest duck-bill, growing up to 16 meters long and as heavy as three bull elephants. Its sheer bulk and herdmates make it all but immune to predation, even from the fearsome Tyrannosaurus.</li>
				<li><b>Tenontosaurus</b> is about the size of a horse. It avoids predators using its speed and will fight only if cornered.</li>
				<li><b>Iguanodon</b> grows to about 9m long and weighs as much as a small elephant. It has very unique hands, sporting a prehensile little finger useful for grasping at food, and a huge thumb spike it uses to ward off predators.</li>
				<li><b>Leaellynasaura</b> is a duck-bill relative most at home in polar forests. It is exceedingly shy and relies on its large eyes to notice danger.</li>
				<li title="this is actually a theropod, meaning it's more closely related to Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus than the duck-bills, but I put it here since it's a plant eater"><b>Therizinosaurus</b> is a tyrannosaurus-sized bipedal dinosaur with meter-long claws. Its enormous claws serve double-duty, both to pull down tree branches and to slash at foes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="pachycephalosaur">Headbutters</h4>
			<p>The headbutting dinosaurs, sometimes known as thickheads, are relatively small herbivorous dinosaurs notable for their thick, bony domes on their skulls. They use these skulls to compete for mates and
				social standing within the faily grouos in which they live. Thickheads are ill-suited for taking on larger predators, and usually prefer flight to fight when given the option.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pachycephalosaurus</b> is up to 5m long and weighs about the same as a pony. It has a crest of spikes around its head-dome that get smaller as it grows older.</li>
				<li><b>Stegoceras</b> grows up to 2m long and weighs as much as an average goat. Its larger size and grazing habits compared to other dinosaurs with similar temperaments makes it well-suited for domestication and herding.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="ceratopsian">Horned Dinosaurs</h4>
			<p>The horned dinosaurs, usually known as hornfaces, are four-legged animals with huge crested heads. They fill niches similar to boars in their ecosystems, using their robust beaks to dig for roots and
				tubers and to break apart tough plant matter. They generally live in small family groups, but some are known to form large herds. Most hornfaces are very aggressive and will not hesitate to savage
				anything they percieve as a threat with their beaks and horns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Despite being a hornface, <b>Protoceratops</b> has no horns. What this boar-sized dinosaur lacks in armaments it makes up for in spirit, as it often attacks intruders in its territory without warning.</li>
				<li><b>Nasutoceratops</b> is the size of a small rhinoceros. Its unusually large snout lets it produce loud honking sounds which it uses to communicate with others of its kind.</li>
				<li>Another hornless hornface, <b>Psittacosaurus</b> is a much smaller and less agressive animal than its peers. It inhabits the undergrowths of woodlands and is more liable to hide than fight.</li>
				<li><b>Styrachosaurus</b> is the size of a large rhinoceros. It uses its great strength and weight to topple foes and trample them to death.</li>
				<li><b>Triceratops</b> is the largest kind of horn-face. As big as an elephant and fiercer than one, it uses the same tactics as styrachosaurus to even greater effects.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="sauropod">Longnecks</h4>
			<p>The hulking longnecks are the largest kind of dinosaur. Most are nigh on immune to predation from their sheer size, and all but the biggest or hungriest predators know to leave them alone. Longnecks use
				the necks that give them their names to reach plants both high and wide, moving their massive bodies as little as possible as they feed.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Amargasaurus</b> is small for a longneck, about the size of an elephant. It has a sail on its neck that helps protect it, and lets it communicate with others of its kind. An amargasaurus fights using its tail, much like the larger brontosaurus.</li>
				<li><b>Brontosaurus</b> is the most common kind of longneck. It uses its whip-like tail to ward of any creature foolish enough to attack it.</li>
				<li><b>Dreadnoughtus</b> is the largest of all dinosaurs, unrivaled in size on land only by the oldest dragons. No treetop is beyond the reach of its neck, and few predators survive getting too close to its crushing feet.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="carnosaur" title="it truly pains me to lump all these creatures into this one category, seeing how they aren't actually all that similar">Meat Eaters</h4>
			<p>Dinosaurs include many kinds of large predators, both hunting the big herbivores on land and preying on fish and other aquatic animals. Their forms are many and disparate, and thus generalizing their
				looks and behaviours is a fool's errand.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Baryonyx</b> is a smaller cousin of spinosaurus, and much more at home on land. It is a marine animal, swimming between islands and walking between rivers, hunting on beaches and on shoals in a manner similar to a wading bird.</li>
				<li><b>Carcharodontosaurus</b> is a giant predator not disimilar to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Dr Dhrolin's Dictionary of Dinosaurs says the following regarding its behaviour: "We recommend that
					<i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> be run as a pursuit hunter, which will chase prey over a long distance. When not hunting or resting it should be curious of, but not automatically hostile to, players
					if given a wide berth."</li>
				<li><b>Carnotaurus</b> is a horned pursuit predator, by and large the cheetah of its ecosystems. Its arms are reduced to little more than vestigial tubes, so it catches and kills prey exclusively using its short and powerful head</li>
				<li title="the ambush hunting is creative liberty on my part, as it its darkvision. it would also not be large in life as far as we know, more like medium, but I needed the statblock to be CR1 for reasons so it is what it is.">
					<b>Kaprosuchus*</b> is a long-legged land-dwelling ambush-hunting crocodile commonly found where dinosaurs live. Its intimidating tusks and powerful jaws are used to clamp down on prey and never let go until the unfortunate prey stops struggling.</li>
				<li><b>Spinosaurus</b> terrorizes the smaller animals of its freshwater habitats. It floats around on the water's surface, head poised to strike like a stork at any unfortunate fish or small swimming animals that get too close. However, spinosaurus is also capable of chasing down prey in water if need be. Spinosaurus has a large sail on its back, which it uses to communicate with others of its kind, warning them to not intrude on its territory.</li>
				<li><b>Torvosaurus</b> is smaller and slower than the fearsome tyrannosaurus, though equally as savage. It hunts by ambushing its prey, then crushing its bones with its powerful jaws</li>
				<li title="the monster manual vastly overestimates t-rex, but I can't be bothered to change the statblock to be more reasonable">The mighty <b>Tyrannosaurus</b> terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, and there are few
					creatures it won't try to devour whole. While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that try to dart in to steal its meal.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="pterosaur" title="These are actually pretty closely related to dinosaurs, but aren't quite there. Kind of like how hyenas aren't quite cats.">Pterodactyls*</h4>
			<p>Pterodactyls are hairy, flying reptiles. Smaller pterodactyls fill roles similar to birds or bats in some dinosaur-dominated ecosystems, but many grow much larger than birds or bats ever could. Their
				bodies are perfect for flight, and their powerful wings are also well-suited for walking on, making them nimble in both the air and on the ground.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pteranodons</b> have wingspans of 5 to 7 meters and typically dive for small marine prey, though they are opportunists and will attack any creature that appears edible. A pteranodon has no teeth, instead using its sharp beak to stab prey too large to swallow with one gulp.</li>
				<li><b>Quetzalcoatlus</b> is a giant pterodactyl, with a wingspan exceeding 10 meters and standing as tall as a giraffe on the ground. Its size lets it hunt comfortably on the ground, swallowing whatever will fit down its gullet and still let it fly.</li>
				<li><b>Ramphorynchus</b> is about the size of a seagull, and lives much like one. It flies along the water's surface on the lookout for fish, and dives beneath to catch its quarry.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="dromaeosaur" title="not all of these are raptors in the popular sense of the word, but I'm making this easy on myself.">Raptors</h4>
			<p>Feathered, agile, and usually small, raptors look more like birds with tails and teeth than they do other dinosaurs. The purely carnivorous raptors tend to hunt in packs, cooperating to bring down
				prey much larger than themselves. Their social nature make raptors great candidates for pets in similar roles to dogs or cats in dinosaur-adjacent societies.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The archetypical raptor, <b>Deinonychus</b> is roughly the size of a wolf. It uses its large talons to slash prey to death.</li>
				<li>As big as a crow, <b>Microraptor</b> is easy to underestimate. However, this diminutive creature will form large flocks to mob down far larger animals than any other dinosaur its size would dare attack. It sports wing feathers on both its arms and legs, and can fly short distances to and from tree branches in the forests it calls home.</li>
				<li>The cat-sized <b>Mononykus</b> is much more timid than any of its kin. it sports one large claw on each of its hands, which it uses to break into old logs and insect nests to get at the larvae within.</li>
				<li><b>Oviraptor</b> is an omnivorous raptor the size of a large swan. It is notable for the care it puts into raising its young, and will defend its nest agressively.</li>
				<li><b>Utahraptor</b> is as big as a polar bear and just as fierce. In a pack, they can bring down even creatures as fierce as an Iguanodon or Triceratops.</li>
				<li><b>Velociraptor</b> is about the size of a turkey. It is an aggressive predator and will hunt bigger prey in relation to its own size than either Deinonychus or Utahraptor.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="marinereptile" title="None of these animals is any more a dinosaur than a platypus is a monkey, but since they go with dinosaur settings and vibes it unfortunately makes the most sense to lump them all together like this for most people.">Sea Dinosaurs*</h4>
			<p>Where dinosaurs rule the land, a menagerie of other similarly fearsome creatures rule the seas.</p>
			<ul>
				<li title="this thing isn't contemporary with dinosaurs. in fact, it's about as old to dinosaurs as a whole as Iguanodon is to us.">The fearsome <b>Dunkleosteus</b> is an armored fish the size of a giant shark. It attacks most anything it comes across, using its shearing jaws to cut chunks of meat from its prey whether it is alive or dead.</li>
				<li>Propelled by four powerful flippers, <b>Kronosaurus</b> is a nimble hunter in spite of its size. Its powerful jaws can crush bone and even cleave smaller prey in two.</li>
				<li><b>Mosasaurus</b> is the Tyrannosaurus of the sea, bigger and nastier than any other predator around. It makes quick work of prey, using its serrated teeth to rip the unfortunate victim limb from limb.</li>
				<li title="this is more based on elasmosaurus since that one is more distinct"><b>Plesiosaurus</b> is an ambush hunter of small marine life. It lies in wait patiently for unaware fish to enter its strike range, which is made so much longer but the flexible neck accounting for over half or the plesiosaurus' length.</li>	
			</ul>
			<h4 id="notdinosaur" title="see the entries">Other Ancient Animals*</h4>
			<p>Some other creatures that might appear alongside dinosaurs are listed here. (ok so only this one for now but I might add more in the future)</p>
			<ul>
				<li title="Hyperodapedon is an archosaur, so it's about as close to dinosaurs as crocodiles are. It did live alongside dinosaurs, such as Herrerasaurus"><b>Hyperodapedon</b> is a buck-toothed burrower roughly as big as a nile monitor. It uses its teeth to break apart tough plant matter, as well as to deal nasty bites to would-be predators.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="deadbug">Ancient Creepy-Crawlies</h4>
			<p>
				Associated with dinosaurs are a number of extinct bugs, and other invertebrates, some of which are represented here. Some of them were extinct in reality before the dinosaurs came around, but they
				nevertheless make good additions to dinosaur-filled settings for that extra dose of prehistoric flavour.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Trilobites</b> cover the ocean floor, sifting through the sediment for miniscule prey items to feed on. Most are about the size of a human hand and pose no threat to larger animals whatsoever.</li>
				<li><b>Sea Scorpions</b> are powerful predators, a nightmare combination of crab and fish. They lie in wait for fish to come too close, then grasp them with their serrated claws. Though no sea scorpion
					hunts humans, the largest ones can grow over two meters long and break an arm with their claws.</li>
				<li>An <b>Ammonite</b> is a shelled relative of octopuses and squid. Its shell is filled with gases that keep the creature boyant as it leisurely drifts around near the sea surface looking for plankton
					to eat. A threatened ammonite will retreat into its shell for protection or escape at high speeds by expelling jets of water.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 id="drdhrolin">Magical Dinosaurs</h4>
			<p>
				The magical dinosaurs are slightly streamlined versions of the creatures in the palaeontology-themed supplementary book Dr. Dhrolin's Dictionary of Dinosaurs. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for
				its wonderful artwork and great suggestions for how to design a survival environment.<br>
				These creatures are not meant to be animals that fill up a world. Rather, they are anomalous rarities, akin to a winter wolf or a basilisk. Whether you want to use them as animals or monstrosities, I
				have included the behaviour suggestions from the book below as inspiration.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Arizonasaurus:</b> We suggest playing <i>Arizonasaurus</i> as a patient predator, willing to rest for extended periods. This can give the impression that it is a sedate animal, but an attack could
					come at any moment. Smaller party members should be more at risk, as they are seen as easier prey</li>
				<li><b>Beipiaosaurus:</b> We recommend <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> be played as a relatively relaxed and seemingly sedate animal, that can erupt into an aggressive display of sharp claws if disturbed.
					Adults should be particularly hostile if in groups or near nesting sites.</li>
				<li><b>Bolong:</b> We suggest Bolong be played as an apparently peaceful grazing animal, but with both the capacity for extreme aggression (especially if protecting young) and sudden panic, fleeing
					en masse.</li>
				<li><b>Psittacosaurus:</b> We recommend that <i>Psittacosaurus</i> be played as a dinosaurian equivalent to sheep, gathering in huge herds with some individuals maintaining a lookout. Upon spotting
					a threat, they should be more prone to fleeing, using their numbers to confuse their attackers. They should only stand and fight in desperate situations when unable to flee.</li>
				<li><b>Yutyrannus:</b> We suggest that <i>Yutyrannus</i> be played as a dominant active predator living in small groups. During colder periods, they should be hunting considerably more to help
					maintain their energy reserves. Hunting <i>Yutyrannus</i> should be a deadly threat, able to pursue prey for a long time and potentially coordinate their attacks. When not hunting, they can be
					resting or be socialising, bickering and playing with each other. Nevertheless, they should opportunistically attack a party if they see them as easy prey.</li>
				<li><b>Leptocleidus:</b> We suggest that <i>Leptocleidus</i> be played as a wary animal. Most humanoids should be too large to be considered potential prey, but players entering the water may be
					considered a disturbance to their feeding or breeding grounds, which could result in an attack—especially if the animal has limited options to escape. If more than one <i>Leptocleidus</i> is in
					the area (especially a mother and large calf), they may attack in a co-ordinated manner, making them much more dangerous to unlucky parties.</li>

					<h2>Displacer Beast</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					This monstrous predator takes its name from its ability to displace light so that it appears to be several feet away from its actual location. A dis placer beast resembles a sleek great cat
					covered in blue-black fur. However, its otherworldly origins are clear in its six legs and the two tentacles sprouting from its shoulders, both ending in pads tipped with spiky protrusions. A
					displacer beast's eyes glow with an awful malevolence that persists even in death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Displacer beasts roamed the twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce
					their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to
					escape their masters. Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court. With blink dog companions at their side, fey hunters drove
					these predators to the fringes of the Feywild, where many crossed over to the Material Plane. To this day, displacer beasts and blink dogs attack each other on sight. Intelligent evil creatures
					favor displacer beasts as pets, but a displacer beast enters such an alliance only if it appears beneficial. A displacer beast might guard a vault or act as a bodyguard for a prominent individual.
				</p>
				<p title="this is literally just what cats do minus the tentacle bit">
					Displacer beasts kill not just for food but also for sport. They target prey even when not hungry, often toying with their victims to entertain themselves until they are ready to eat. After
					killing its prey using its tentacles, a displacer beast drags the corpse to a quiet place where it can feed without distraction.
					Displacer beasts hunt alone or in small prides that demonstrate skill at setting ambushes. A single beast will strike and withdraw, luring prey into a densely wooded area where its packmates
					wait. Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.

			<details id="draug">
				<summary>
					<h2>Draug</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A draug (pl. <i>draugar</i>) is a terrible evil, a wight-like undead risen for the sole purpose of wreaking havoc and spreading misery. Bound to the barrow in which they were buried, a draug
					typically rises because its rest was disturbed or its tomb disrespected. Yet the one who did the disturbing might never see the consequences. A draug is active only at night, and attacks all
					creatures it can find with extreme prejudice. The only way to stop a draug once risen is to destroy it completely. One way to do so is to expose its incapacitated body to sunlight, which burns
					the creature to ashes. Incapacitating a draug is no small feat, however, for it is possessed of supernatural strength and complete immunity to all but the mightiest weapons.
				</p>
				<p>
					In combat, a draug fights with fearless malevolence, no matter the foe, and relents only when destroyed or when dawn draws too close. Draugar are not mindless brutes, however, and use all the
					tools at their disposal to their fuillest. They alter their form and glide through the earth to gain every advantage they can. Draugar who have the upper hand might toy with their victims. They
					particularly like to sit on their victim's torso, slowly increasing in weight until the victim is crushed.
				</p>
				<h4 id="drauglair">A Draug's Lair</h4>
				<p>
					The draug retains a connection to its place of burial, which is a barrow or some other tomb. It doesn't need to return there, but it is the only place where it can regenerate and otherwise
					benefit from a long rest. The area in a 1-mile radius surrounding the draug's barrow are subject to the following effects while the creature is there:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Beasts who feed in the area are driven insane and start attacking anything they see, stopping only once they fall dead from exhaustion.</li>
					<li>Humanoids who attempt to rest in the area are plagued by worry and nightmares, preventing them from gaining the benefits of a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If the draug is killed, these effects end immediately.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details id="drider">
				<summary>
					<h2>Drider</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					When a drow shows great promise, Lolth summons it to the Demonweb Pits for a test of faith and strength. Those that pass the test rise higher in the Spider Queen's favor. Those that fail are
					transformed into driders—a horrid hybrid of a drow and a giant spider that serves as a living reminder of Lolth's power. Only drow can be turned into driders, and the power to create these
					creatures resides with Lolth alone. Drow transformed into driders return to the Material Plane as twisted and debased creatures. Driven by madness, they disappear into the Underdark to become
					hermits and hunters, either wandering alone or leading packs of giant spiders. On rare occasion, a drider returns to the fringes of drow society despite its curse, most often to fulfill some
					longstanding vow or vendetta from its former life. Drow fear and shun the driders, holding them in lower esteem than slaves. However, they tolerate the presence of these creatures as living
					representatives of Lolth's will, and a reminder of the fate that awaits all who fail the Spider Queen.

					<h2>Dullahan</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Dullahans are headless undead warriors—the remains of villains who let vengeance consume them. These decapitated hunters haunt the areas where they were slain, butchering innocents in search of
					their severed heads or to quench their thirst for revenge. Wicked knights or commanders in life, dullahans adhere to twisted codes of chivalry or soldiership. These fallen champions consider a
					specific location their battlefield. This gives rise to stories of haunted battlegrounds, ruins, roads, river crossings and other strategic locations where a dullahan continues a terrifying
					campaign against the living. In death, dullahans are often rejoined by those who followed them in life, either in the form of lesser undead, like skeletons or wights, or terrifying mounts, like
					warhorse skeletons or nightmares.
				</p>
				<h4>Headless Hunts</h4>
				<p>
					Dullahans are known for seeking their lost heads, giving rise to regional legends of headless hunters and endless searches. The table below suggests dullahan hauntings that might

					<h2>Eidolon</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The gods have many methods for protecting sites they deem holy. One servant they rely on often to do so is the eidolon, a ghostly spirit bound by a sacred oath to safeguard a place of import to
					the divine. Forged from the souls of those who had proven their unwavering devotion , eidolons stalk temples and vaults, places where miracles have been witnessed and relics enshrined, to ensure
					that no enemy can gain a foothold against the gods' cause through defilement or violence within these sites. If an enemy with such intent sets foot inside a warded location, the eidolon plunges
					into a graven vessel, a statue specially prepared to house the souls of these protectors. The eidolon then animates the effigy and uses the borrowed body to drive out the intruders bent on
					plundering the relics it is charged with guarding.<br>
					Creating an eidolon requires a spirit of fanatical devotion—that of an individual who, in life, served with unwavering faithfulness. Upon death, a god might reward such a follower with
					everlasting service in the protection of a holy site. An eidolon has no purpose beyond guarding the place it was assigned to and never leaves.<br>
					An eidolon has few methods for protecting itself beyond its ability to awaken its sacred vessels. When a foe enters, the eidolon leaps into action by merging its body with one of several statues
					at the site. After doing so, the eidolon controls the construct as if it was its own body and uses its fists to drive back intruders, smashing and crushing anything it can reach.<br>
					Gods are not the only beings with the power to create an eidolon. Lesser, but still very powerful beings, such as archdevils, can do it too.

			<details><!-- Elementals -->
				<summary>
					<h2>Elementals</h2>
					<p>Elementals are incarnations of the elements that make up the universe: air, earth, fire, and water. Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called
						on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.</p>
				</summary>
				<p>
					On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no
					desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.
				</p>
				<p>
					Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound
					into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it. Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and
					function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds. The strength of the magic and materials that bind
					an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can't bind elemental
					power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.
				</p>
				<h2>Basic Elementals</h2>
				<h4 id="airelemental">Air Elemental</h4>
				<p>
					An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face. Although it likes to race across the ground, picking up dust and debris as it goes, it can also fly and
					attack from above. An air elemental can turn itself into a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures even as it flings them away.
				</p>
				<h4 id="earthelemental">Earth Elemental</h4>
				<p>
					An earth elemental plods forward like a walking hill, club-like arms of jagged stone swinging at its sides. Its head and body consist of dirt and stone, occasionally set with chunks of metal,
					gems, and bright minerals. Earth elementals glide through rock and earth as though they were liquid. Earthbound creatures have much to fear from an earth elemental, since the elemental can
					pinpoint the precise location of any foe that stands on solid ground in its vicinity.
				</p>
				<h4 id="fireelemental">Fire Elemental</h4>
				<p>
					A faint humanoid shape threads through the core of this wild, moving flame. A fire elemental is a force of capricious devastation. Wherever it moves, it sets its surroundings ablaze, turning the
					world to ash, smoke, and cinders. Water can halt its destructive progress, causing the fire elemental to shrink back, hissing and smoking in pain and rage.
				</p>
				<h4 id="waterelemental">Water Elemental</h4>
				<p>
					A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures tha stand against it, filling their
					mouths and lungs as easily as it smothers flame.
				</p>
				<h2>Elder Elementals</h2>
				<p>
					On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they
					have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises
					destruction. The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of
					superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members
					of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.
				</p>
				<h4 id="eldertempest">Elder Tempest</h4>
				<p>
					Terrifying storms manifest in the body of the elder tempest. A being carved from clouds, wind, rain, and lightning, the elder tempest assumes the shape of a serpent that slithers through the sky.
					The tempest drowns the land beneath it with rain and stabs the earth with lances of lightning. Punishing winds scream around it as it flies, feeding the chaos it creates.
				</p>
				<p>
					A galeb duhr can become one with the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr uses its animated boulders to frighten away
					interlopers and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. When it needs to move close to those intruders, it presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a furious pace.
				</p>
				<h4 id="leviathan">Leviathan</h4>
				<p>
					A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean's depths and washes away coastal settlements—that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. When called
					forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.
				</p>
				<h4 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h4>
				<p>
					Releasing a phoenix from the Inner Planes creates an explosion of fire that spreads across the sky. An enormous fiery bird forms in the center of the flames and smoke—an elder elemental possessed
					by a need to burn everything to ash. The phoenix rarely stays in one place for long as it strives to transform the world into an inferno.
				</p>
				<h4 id="zaratan">Zaratan</h4>
				<p>
					When a zaratan is summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth, the ground rises up to take the shape of what looks like a hulking, armored reptile, its shell composed of the landscape from which
					it arose. The zaratan plods across the land, each step sending shock waves through the ground severe enough to unsettle structures. Dim-witted, the zaratan lurches onward, expressing its rage
					through its trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, the zaratan slowly retracts its appendages to gain shelter
					beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.
				</p>
				<h2 id="elementalmyrmidon">Elemental Myrmidons</h2>
				<p>
					Elemental myrmidons are elementals conjured and bound by magic into ritually created suits of plate armor. In this form, they possess no recollection of their former existence as free elementals.
					They exist only to follow the commands of their creators.
				</p>
				<h2 id="galebduhr">Galeb Duhr</h2>
				<p>
					The galeb duhr is a boulder-like creature with stumpy appendages that act as arms and legs. It has the ability to animate the rocks and boulders around it, and is thus usually encountered in
					rocky terrain. Powerful magic allows a spellcaster to summon a galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The galeb duhr is imbued
					with greater intelligence than most elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to communicate with creatures entering its guarded area. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A galeb duhr doesn't age or require sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr
					might be created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly still for years at a time.
					A galeb duhr is permanently bound to the Material Plane, so that when it dies, it doesn't return to the Plane of Earth. It has an excellent memory and is more than happy to share information
					regarding its environment with creatures it doesn't regard as threats.
				</p>
				<h2 id="gargoyle">Gargoyle</h2>
				<p>
					The inanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A gargoyle lurks among masonry and
					ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.<br>
					As Ogrémoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with the essence of the
					elemental prince, growing over long years into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles. Ogremoch doesn't create gargoyles deliberately, but
					they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogremoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like their
					creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every opportunity to destroy such creatures.<br>
					Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and
					cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.<br>
					Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures
					are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its
					long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.<br>
					Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves
					minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage. Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle
					guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.
				</p>
				<h2 id="invisiblestalker">Invisible Stalker</h2>
				<p>
					An invisible stalker is an air elemental that has been summoned from its native plane and transformed by powerful magic. Its sole purpose is to hunt down creatures and retrieve objects for its
					summoner. When it is defeated or the magic that binds it expires, an invisible stalker va nishes in a gust of wind. When an invisible stalker is created, it stays at its summoner's side until it
					is given a task to perform. If an assignment doesn't involve hunting down and slaying a specific creature or recovering an object, the magic that created the invisible stalker ends and the
					elemental is released. Otherwise, it completes the task, then returns to its summoner for more commands, forced to serve until the magic that binds it expires. If its summoner dies in the
					interim, the invisible stalker vanishes after completing its task. An invisible stalker is an unwilling servant at best. It resents any undertaking assigned to it. A mission that requires
					significant time might drive the invisible stalker to pervert the intent of a command unless it is worded carefully.
				</p>
				<p>
					Invisible stalkers are composed of air and are naturally invisible. A creature might hear and feel an invisible stalker in passing, but the elemental remains invisible even when it attacks. A
					spell that allows someone to see the invisible reveals only the invisible stalker's vague outline.
				</p>
				<h2 id="magmin">Magmin</h2>
				<p>
					A grinning, mischievous magmin resembles a stumpy humanoid sculpted from a black shell of magma. Even when it isn't ablaze and radiating heat like a bonfire, small jets of flame erupt from its
					porous skin. Magmins are fire elemental spirits bound into physical forms by magic, and they appear in the Material Plane only when summoned. They view flammable objects as kindling for a grand
					conflagration, and only the magical control exerted by their summoners keeps them from setting everything they touch ablaze. Their propensity for fire and havoc makes them ideal for spreading
					chaos and destruction. A mob of magmins summoned inside a castle can reduce it to a burning shell within minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although its flame is potent, the magmin's hard magma shell prevents it from instantly igniting everything it comes into contact with. However, like the fires inside them, magmins are capricious
					and unpredictable. Moreover, as simple elemental creations, they are oblivious to the harm their native element causes creatures of the Material Plane. If it has the opportunity while in service
					to its master, a magmin seeks out areas of great heat, such as forest fires or the bubbling magma of an active volcano. At other times, a magmin compulsively looses fire from its fingertips,
					delighting in setting objects ablaze. 
				</p>
				<h2 id="mephits">Mephits</h2>
				<p>
					Mephits are capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes. They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements. Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in
					large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For
					example, a magma mephitis, composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales. 
				</p>
				<h4>Dust Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Composed of earth and air, dust mephits are drawn to catacombs and find death morbidly fascinating.
				</p>
				<h4>Ice Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Comprising frigid air and water, ice mephits are aloof and cold, surpassing all other mephits in pitiless cruelty
				</p>
				<h4>Magma Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Composed of earth and fire, magma mephits glow a dull red color as they perspire beads of molten lava. They are slow to comprehend the meaning of others' words and actions.
				</p>
				<h4>Mud Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Mud mephits are slow, unctuous creatures of earth and water. They drone their complaints to all who will listen, and beg incessantly for attention and treasure. 
				</p>
				<h4>Smoke Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Smoke mephits are crude, lazy creatures of air and fire that billow smoke constantly. They rarely speak the truth and love to mock and mislead other creatures.
				</p>
				<h4>Steam Mephit</h4>
				<p>
					Composed of fire and water, steam mephits leave trails of hot water wherever they go, and they hiss with tendrils of steam. Bossy and hypersensitive, they are the self-appointed overlords of all
					mephits.
				</p>
				<h2 id="thunderbird">Thunderbird</h2>
				<p>
					The roc-sized thunderbird is rarely seen by ground-dwellers. It prefers to dwell high in the clouds, where it flies joyfully through thunderheads, reveling in and creating lightning strikes. When
					a thunderbird can't find any thunderheads, it creates its own. Some cultures revere thunderbirds as bringers of rain and messengers of fertility gods.
				</p>
				<h2 id="waterweird">Water Weird</h2>
				<p>
					A water weird is an elemental guardian bound to a specific water-filled location, such as a pool or founfain. Invisible while immersed in water, its serpentine shape becomes clear only when it
					emerges to attack, using its coils to crush any creature other than its summoner and those its summoner declares as off limits. When slain, a water weird becomes an inanimate pool of water. Like
					most elementals, a water weird has no concept of good or evil. However, a water weird bound to a sacred or befouled source of water begins to take on the nature of that site, becoming good or
					evil. A good water weird tries to frighten away interlopers rather than kill them, while a evil water weird kills its victims for pleasure and might turn against its summoner. A water weird loses
					its evil alignment if its waters are cleansed with a <i>Purify Food and Drink</i> spell.
				</p>
				<h2>Weirds of Ravnica</h2>
				<p>
					Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control.
					As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless,
					they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.
				</p>
				<h4 id="blistercoilweird">Blistercoil Weird</h4>
				<p>
					A blistercoil weird is an anthropomorphic brute formed from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from magical fire, causing its oozelike body to increase in size. During one disastrous
					experiment, Izzet researchers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fill a six-story workshop before it released all its excess energy in an enormous explosion and returned to its original
					size.
				</p>
				<h4 id="fluxcharger">Fluxcharger</h4>
				<p>
					In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium. The
					experiment was partly successful: the resulting weird, a Fluxcharger, doesn't explode like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and more headstrong than other weirds. A fluxcharger's
					mizzium frame is suggestive of an angel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but most people find its solemn expression and unblinking stare more unnerving than relatable.
				</p>
				<h4 id="galvaniceweird">Galvanice Weird</h4>
				<p>
					GaJvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops. They combine a rigid body of
					elemental ice with a core of lightning that animates them. If a galvanice weird is destroyed, the ice shatters and lightning crackles outward in a dangerous explosion. Still, most Izzet
					researchers find that their usefulness outweighs this risk. 
				</p>
				<h2 id="xorn">Xorn</h2>
				<p>
					Bizarre creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, xorn sniff out gemstones and precious metals, then tunnel through earth and rock to consume those treasures. On the Material Plane, xorn
					must range far and wide through the Underdark to sustain themselves, becoming aggressive toward miners and treasure hunters when the valuable minerals of their diet are scarce. A xorn's unnatural
					origins are suggested by its unusually heavy body and the large, powerful mouth sitting atop its head . Its three long arms are each tipped with sharp talons, and its three large, stone-lidded
					eyes see in all directions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Possessed of the power of elemental earth, a xorn glides through stone and dirt as easily as a fish swims through water. It doesn't displace earth or stone when it moves, but merges with and
					flows through it, leaving no tunnel, hole, or hint of its passage. Xorn prefer not to leave their home plane, where they easily eat their fill of gemstones and precious metals. When a xorn winds
					up on the Material Plane, whether by accident or from curiosity, it seeks sustenance and a way home. Xorn scour the depths of the earth for precious metal and stones. Because they are unable to
					consume organic material, they ignore most other creatures. However, a xorn's ability to sniff out metals and stones often draws its attention to adventurers carrying coins and gems. Because a
					xorn isn't evil, it pleads or bargains in the hope of convincing owners to give up their treasure, offering up information it has learned from its travels in exchange. A xorn whose requests are
					ignored might resort to threats and bullying. If starving or angered, it resorts to force.

					<h2>Empyrean</h2>
					<p>
						Empyreans are the celestial children of the gods of the Upper Planes. They are universally beautiful, statuesque, and self-assured.
					</p>
				</summary>
				<p>
					An empyrean can experience deity-like fits of serenity or rage. It can affect the environment around it by its mood. When an empyrean is unhappy, the clouds might cry tears of salt water, the
					wildflowers in surrounding meadows might wilt, dead fish might wash ashore in lakes or rivers, or a nearby forest might lose the leaves from its trees. When an empyrean is jubilant, sunlight
					follows it everywhere, small animals frolic in its footsteps, and birds fill the sky with their pleasing songs.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few empyreans have turned to evil after venturing to the Lower Planes and becoming corrupted, or as the result of being cursed by evil gods. An evil empyrean can't survive long on the Upper
					Planes and usually retreats to the Material Plane, where it can rule over a kingdom of mortals as an indomitable tyrant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Empyreans don't age but can be slain. Because few empyreans can imagine their own demise, they fight fearlessly when drawn into battle, refusing to believe that the end is upon them even when
					standing at death's door. When an empyrean dies, its spirit returns to its home plane. There, one of the fallen empyrean's parents resurrects the empyrean unless they have a good reason not
					to.

			<details id="ettercap">
				<summary>
					<h2>Ettercap</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Ettercaps are humanoid spiders that tend, feed, and watch over spiders the way a shepherd oversees a flock of sheep. They lair deep in remote forests. Fine strands of silk stream from glands in
					an ettercap's abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon
					its lair. When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs.
					Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its venomous bite.<br>
					Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant
					spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the
					ettercaps' victims.<br>
					Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad's tree in webbing in a vain
					attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures
					themselves.

				<summary>
					<h2>Assorted Fiends</h2>
					<p>
						Though most fiends in the multiverse are either Demons, Devils, or Yugoloths, there is still a plethora of creatures that are not. Most of their descriptions are fairly short, and it thus
						makes sense to have them all in a single tab like this.
					</p>
				</summary>
				<h2 id="cambion">Cambion</h2>
				<p>
					A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy
					tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage. Cambions grow into ruthless adults whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion
					identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it. A cambion forced to serve
					its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells serve as soldiers,
					envoys, and personal attendants to greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.
				</p>
				<p>
					The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are
					characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, sixfingered hands, and unearthly beauty.
				</p>
				<h2 id="devourer">Devourer</h2>
				<p>
					Of all the abominations Orcus has unleashed, devourers are among the most feared. These tall, mummy-like fiends wander the planes, consuming souls and, by example, spreading Orcus's creed of
					replacing all life with everlasting death.<br>
					A lesser demon that proves itself to Orcus might be granted the privilege of becoming a devourer. The Prince of Undeath transforms such a demon into an 8-foot-tall, desiccated humanoid with a
					hollowed-out ribcage, then fills the new creature with a hunger for souls. Orcus grants each new devourer the essence of a less fortunate demon to power the devourer's first foray into the
					planes. Most devourers remain in the Abyss, or on the Astral or Ethereal Plane, pursuing Orcus's schemes and interests in those realms. When Orcus sends devourers to the Material Plane, he often
					sets them on a mission to create, control, and lead a plague of undead. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, and shadows are particularly attracted to the presence of a devourer.<br>
					Devourers hunt humanoids, with the intent of consuming them body and soul. After a devourer brings a target to the brink of death, it pulls the victim's body in and traps the creature within its
					own ribcage. As the victim tries to stave off death (usually without success), the devourer tortures its soul with telepathic noise. When the victim expires, it undergoes a horrible
					transformation, springing forth from the devourer's body to begin its new existence as an undead servitor of the monster that spawned it.
				</p>
				<h2 id="nightmare">Nightmare</h2>
				<p>
					A nightmare appears in a cloud of roiling smoke, its mane, tail, and hooves wreathed in flame. The creature's unearthly black form moves with supernatural speed, vanishing in a cloud of brimstone
					as quickly as it appeared.<br>
					Also called a "demon horse" or "hell horse," the nightmare serves as a steed for creatures of exceptional evil, carrying demons, devils, death knights, liches, night hags, and other vile
					monsters. It resembles a fiendish horse, and a nightmare's fiery red eyes betray its malevolent intelligence. A nightmare can be summoned from the Lower Planes, but unless a worthy sacrifice is
					offered to it as food upon its arrival, the nightmare displays no special loyalty to the creature it serves.<br>
					Nightmares don't appear naturally in the multiverse. They must be created from pegasi. The ritual that creates a nightmare requires the torturous removal of a pegasus's wings, driving that noble
					creature to evil as it is transformed by dark magic
				</p>
				<h2 id="nightmareshepherd">Nightmare Shepherd</h2>
				<p>
					A nightmare shepherd is a gaunt, ashen fiend with leathery wings. Hailing from the world of Theros, it carries a shepherd's crook, which it uses to direct a flock of wandering dead that it
					torments and occasionally feeds upon. Nightmare shepherds are Nyxborn, drawn from the god-energy of Erebos to be guides of the dead, shepherding them to one of the five wards of the Underworld
					where they will spend their dismal eternity. They prey upon souls who wander from their rightful places in the Underworld.
				</p>
				<h2 id="rakshasa">Rakshasa</h2>
				<p>
					The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it
					prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one
					noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.<br>
					Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters
					the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret. For a rakshasa, death on the
					Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms—a process that cart take months or years. When the rakshasa is
					reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might
					punish its killer's family, friends, or descendants. Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are forever destroyed. 
				</p>
				<h2 id="succubus">Succubus/Incubus</h2>
				<p>
					Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the
					Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts. Though legend speaks of them separately, any
					succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa, although most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form,
					however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give
					in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in
					everyday life. Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in
					the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will. A mortal bequeaths its soul to the
					fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely—some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and
					deed—the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the
					succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes. The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of
					self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it,
					experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is
					conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.

					<h2>Flameskull</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Blazing green flames and mad, echoing laughter follow a disembodied skull as it patrols its demesne. When the undead flameskull discovers trespassers, it blasts the intruders with fiery rays from
					its eyes and dreadful spells called up from the dark recesses of its memory. Dark spellcasters fashion flameskulls from the remains of dead wizards. When the ritual is complete, green flames
					erupt from the skull to complete its ghastly transformation. A flameskull only dimly recalls its former life. Though it might speak in its old voice and recount key events from its past, it is
					but an echo of its former self. However, its undead transformation grants it full access to the magic it wielded in life, letting it cast spells while ignoring the material and somatic components
					it can no longer employ. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Intelligent and vigilant, a flameskull serves its creator by protecting a hidden treasure hoard, a secret chamber, or a specific individual. A flameskull carries out the directives given to it
					when it was created, and it interprets those commands to the letter. A flameskull's master must craft its instructions with care to ensure that the creature carries out its tasks properly. The
					fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye
					sockets. A flameskull's shattered fragments reform unless they are splashed with holy water or subjected to a dispel magic or remove curse spell. If it can no longer fulfill its intended purpose,
					the re-formed flameskull is beholden to no one and becomes autonomous.

					The mysterious flumphs drift through the Underdark, propelled through the air by the jets whose sound gives them their name. A flumph glows faintly, reflecting its moods in its color. Soft pink
					means it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger.<br>
					Flumphs communicate telepathically. Though they resemble jellyfish, flumphs are sentient beings of great intelligence and wisdom, possessing advanced knowledge of religion, philosophy,
					mathematics, and countless other subjects. Flumphs are sensitive to the emotional states of nearby creatures. If a creature's thoughts suggest goodness, a flumph seeks that creature out. When 
					facing creatures that exude evil, a flumph flees.<br>
					Flumphs feed by siphoning mental energy from psionic creatures, and they can be found lurking near communities of mind flayers, aboleths, githyanki, and githzerai. As passive parasites, they take
					only the mental energy they need, and most creatures feel no loss or discomfort from such feeding. Consuming psionic energy reveals the thoughts and emotions of the creatures on which the flumphs
					feed. Since so many of those creatures are evil, flumphs are often subjected to thoughts, emotions, and hungers that sicken their pure nature. When flumphs encounter good-hearted adventurers,
					they eagerly share the dark secrets they have learned in the hopes of casting down their evil sources of energy, even if doing so means they must seek out new sources of nourishment.<br>
					Flumphs live in complex and organized groups called cloisters, within which each flumph has a place and purpose. These harmonious groupings have no need for leaders, since all flumphs contribute
					in their own way.

					<h2>Froghemoth</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A froghemoth is an amphibious predator as big as an elephant. It lairs in swamps and has four tentacles, a thick rubbery hide, a fang-filled maw with a prehensile tongue, and an extendable stalk
					sporting three bulbous eyes that face in different directions. Every few years, a froghemoth can lay a fertile egg without mating. The froghemoth cares nothing for its egg, and might eat it the
					hatchling. A young froghemoth's survival is most often predicated on its parent leaving it behind in indifference. A newborn froghemoth grows to full size over a period of months by
					indiscriminately preying on other creatures in its swampy domain. It learns to hide its enormous body in murky pools, keeping only its eyestalk above water to watch for passing creatures. When
					food comes within reach, the froghemoth erupts from its pool, tentacles and tongue flailing. It can grab several targets at once, keeping them at bay while it wraps its tongue around another one
					and pulls it in to be devoured.<br>
					Froghemoths are creatures not of this world. A journal purportedly written long ago by the wizard Lum the Mad describes strange, cylindrical chambers of metal buried in the ground from which
					froghemoths emerged, but no reliable reports of the location of such places exist.<br>
					If a bullywug tribe comes across a froghemoth, the bullywugs treat the froghemoth as a god and do all they can to coax the monster into their den. A froghemoth can be tamed (after a fashion) by
					offering it food, and bullywugs can communicate with it on a basic level, so the creature might eat only a few bullywugs before following the rest. Bullywugs gather food as tribute for it,
					provide it with a comfortable lair, fanatically protect it from harm, and try to ensure that any young froghemoth reaches maturity.

					<h2>Fungi</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					With its sky of jagged stone and perpetual night, the Underdark is home to all manner of fungi. Taking the place of plants in the subterranean realm, fungi are vital to the survival of many
					underground species, providing nourishment and shelter in the unforgiving darkness. Fungi spawn in organic matter, then break that matter down to consume it, feeding on filth and corpses. As they
					mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi. Not needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by
					the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack. The largest specimens can spread to create vast
					subterranean forests in which countless creatures live and feed.
				</p>
				<h4>Gas Spore</h4>
				<p>
					The first gas spores are thought to have been spawned from dead beholders, whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since adapted into a unique plant
					creature, a gas spore grows quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen of the Underdark.<br>
					A gas spore is a spherical, balloon-like fungus that resembles a beholder from a distance, a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does. Its true
					nature becomes increasingly obvious as one approaches it. The monster possesses a blind central "eye" and rhizome growths sprouting from its upper surface, superficially resembling a beholder's
					eyestalks.<br>
					Piercing the shell of a gas spore with even the weakest attack causes the creature to burst apart, releasing a cloud of deadly spores. A creature that inhales the spores becomes host to them, and
					is often dead within a day. Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.<br>
					A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift. Any
					creature that inhales the spores and survives inherits one or more of the beholder's fragmented memories, and might gain useful information about the beholder's former lair and other nearby
					places and creatures of interest.
				</p>
				<h4>Shrieker</h4>
				<p>
					A shrieker is a human-sized mushroom that emits a piercing screech to drive off creatures that disturb it. Other creatures use the fungi as an alarm to signal the approach of prey, and various
					intelligent races of the Underdark cultivate shriekers on the outskirts of their communities to discourage trespassers.
				</p>
				<h4>Violet Fungus</h4>
				<p>
					This purplish mushroom uses root-like feelers growing from its base to creep across cavern floors. The four stalks protruding from a violet fungi's central mass are used to lash out at prey,
					rotting flesh with the slightest touch. Any creature killed by a violet fungus decomposes rapidly. A new violet fungus sprouts from the moldering corpse, growing to full size in 2d6 days.

				<summary>
					<h2>Genies</h2>
					<p>Genies are rare elemental creatures out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are
						attended by worshipful slaves. Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the
						knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into
					a manifest form and create a genie. A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and sex, as well as
					one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all
					new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal,
					although such offspring are rare. When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of
					wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.<br>
					Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof
					that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating
					them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use. In contrast to their love of slaves,
					most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare
					few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.<br>
					Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant
					indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination. Noble
					genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy
					a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's will and risk the consequences.<br>
					Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees tiresome—except as it is directed
					toward them by their worshipful slaves. Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as
					powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms—even whole continents or worlds—bow down before them.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dao">Dao</h4>
				<p>
					Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from precious gems and rare metals, and when they fly, their lower bodies become
					columns of swirling sand. A dao isn't happy unless it is the envy of other dao.<br>
					The dao dwell in complexes of twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns on the Elemental Plane of Earth. These mazeworks are continually expanding as the dao delve into and reshape the
					rock around them. Dao care nothing for the poverty or misfortune of others. A dao might grind powdered gems and gold dust over its food to heighten the experience of eating, devouring its wealth
					as mortals consume a precious spice.<br>
					A dao never assists a mortal unless the genie has something to gain, preferably treasure. Among the genies, dao are on speaking and trading terms with the efreet, but they have nothing but scorn
					for djinn and marids. Other races native to the Elemental Plane of Earth avoid the dao, which are always seeking new slaves to mine the mazeworks of their floating earth islands.<br>
					The dao trade for the finest slaves that money can buy, forcing them to work in dangerous subterranean realms that rumble with earthquakes. As much as they enjoy enslaving others, the dao hate
					being enslaved. Powerful wizards have been known to lure dao to the Material Plane and trap them in the confines of magic gemstones or iron flasks. Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it
					relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.
				</p>
				<h4 id="djinni">Djinni</h4>
				<p>
					Proud, sensuous genies from the Elemental Plane of Air, the djinn are attractive, tall, well-muscled humanoids with blue skin and dark eyes. They dress in airy, shimmering silks, designed as much
					for comfort as to flaunt their musculature.<br>
					Djinn rule floating islands of clouds tuff covered with enormous pavilions, or topped with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and gardens. Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy
					succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and beautiful music. Djinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with
					efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.<br>
					Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and
					thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.<br>
					The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the genies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they
					never enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with them reluctantly. A mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can
					entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni
					using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments
					throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly vengeance can amend.
				</p>
				<h4 id="efreeti">Efreeti</h4>
				<p>
					Hulking genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, the efreet are masters of flame, immune to fire and able to create it on a whim. Fine silk caftans and damask robes drape their magma-red or
					coal-black skin, and they bedeck themselves in brass and gold torcs, chains, and rings, all glittering with jewels. When an efreeti flies, its lower body transforms into a column of smoke and
					embers.<br>
					The efreet are deceptive, cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness. They despise being forced into servitude and are relentless in pursuit of vengeance against creatures that have wronged
					them. Efreet don't see themselves in this light, naturally, and regard their race as fair and orderly, even as they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest.<br>
					Efreet view all other creatures as enemies or potential serfs. They raid the Material Plane and the elemental planes for slaves, which they capture and bring back to their homes on the Elemental
					Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as oppressive tyrants, promoting only the cruelest among their slaves. Those overseers are given whips to help keep the rank-and-file slaves in line.<br>
					Most efreet reside on the Elemental Plane of Fire, either in great domed fortresses of black glass and basalt surrounded by churning lakes of fire, or in the fabled City of Brass. Additionally,
					efreet military outposts thronging with their minions and slaves can be found scattered throughout the planes. On the Material Plane, efreet dwell in fiery regions such as volcanoes and the
					burning expanses of the world's deserts. Their love of the desert brings them into conflict with the djinn that ride the desert whirlwinds, and with the earthbound dao. Efreet utterly despise
					marids, with whom they have maintained a passionate conflict throughout the history of both races.
				</p>
				<h4 id="marid">Marid</h4>
				<p>
					Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the
					flighty djinn, the groundhugging dao, and the fuming efreet. Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons
					they favor. They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.<br>
					Water is a marid's native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or
					shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.<br>
					Marids are rare on the Material Plane. They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels float in the depths of the plane and contain
					opulent, airfilled chambers where slaves and guests reside. A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves, simply wanting to have them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to
					obtain skilled slaves, and aren't above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.<br>
					All marids claim a title of nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the self-important marids. Marids treat
					all others—including other genies—as inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet. Humanoids are among the
					lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a
					mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious
					mortal is a creature that knows its place.<br>
					Marids are champion taletellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't
					always malicious in their deception, but embellishments suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to
					invoke its wrath.
				</p>
				<h4 id="geniepowers">Genie Powers</h4>
				<p>
					Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.<br>
					<b>Disguises:</b> Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the <i>Disguise</i> spell on themselves at will, often with a
					longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the <i>True Polymorph</i> spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can
					change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.<br>
					<b>Wishes:</b> The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
					grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law
					dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence. To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a
					desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the
					wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

				<summary>
					<h2>Ghosts, Specters, Phantasms, and other Incorporeal Undead</h2>
				</summary>
				<h2 id="allip">Allip</h2>
				<p>
					When a mind uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the emergence of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon
					lord's true name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order. The allip acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral creature composed of fragments from the
					victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony. Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to
					relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but that piece is enough to wrak the recipient with temporary madness. The
					survivors of an allip's attack are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their
					dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful en counter.
				</p>
				<p>
					An allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its mind by guiding another creature to write down what it knows. This process
					takes days or possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or workplace of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually overcome by manic energy. A
					scholar, driven by sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of text with little memory of exactly what the documents contain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world—and its
					terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar's text, waiting to be discovered by its next victim.
				</p>
				<h2 id="banshee">Banshee</h2>
				<p>
					When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. Banshees appear as
					luminous, wispy forms that vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves
					afflicted by the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the living. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes
					their transformation into undead monsters. A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every moment of
					its life with perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for its doom.
				</p>
				<p>
					The vanity that inspired the banshee's cursed creation persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine jewelry, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time,
					a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to see the horror of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.
				</p>
				<h2 id="gallowsspeaker">Gallows Speaker</h2>
				<p>
					Gallows speakers arise from places of mass death or sites where creatures regularly meet their doom. Over time, pain-wracked phantoms and lingering souls combine into an entity that knows death
					in myriad forms. Such amalgamated spirits are tormented by their collective pain, endlessly moaning disjointed final thoughts as they lash out at the living. Having known untold deaths, gallows
					speakers can predict suffering, foreseeing dooms leveled against them and overwhelming their foes with visions of innumerable violent deaths. Gallows speakers rarely speak coherently or
					communicate with the living, instead being entirely obsessed with their memories of death. These undead endlessly mutter to themselves, giving voice to final curses, regrets, pleas, and
					apologies. Those who linger and listen to a gallows speaker might gain insight into any of its many deaths.
				</p>
				<h2 id="ghost">Ghost</h2>
				<p>
					A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in its life. A ghost yearns to complete some unresolved task
					from its life. It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life.
					Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead. The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to
					resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the
					implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold
					spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no
					control over these manifestations; they simply occur.
				</p>
				<h2 id="phantomwarrior">Phantom Warrior</h2>
				<p>
					A phantom warrior is the spectral remnant of a willful soldier or knight who perished on the battlefield or died performing its sworn duty. It appears like a translucent version of its living
					self. Although one is often mistaken for a ghost, a phantom warrior isn't bound by a yearning to complete some unresolved goal. It can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit
					lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example, a guard who dies defending a wall
					might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it died and the
					time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					A phantom warrior retains the alignment and personality it had before it died, and it remembers how it died. Memories of its life from shortly before it died are hazy, and older memories are
					forgotten. A phantom warrior can usually remember the last 1d10 + 10 days of its life; everything that happened before that is an impenetrable fog.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although they are incorporeal, phantom warriors can harness the energy around them to deflect incoming attacks and strike with great force. An invisible sheath of energy surrounds a phantom
					warrior's ghostly armor, shields, and weapons, which become as hard as steel yet don't impede the warrior's ability to move through walls and other solid objects.
				</p>
				<h2 id="specter">Specter</h2>
				<p>
					A specter is the angry, unfettered spirit of a humanoid that has been prevented from passing to the afterlife. Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned
					to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body. When a ghost's unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such
					rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn
					places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.<br>
					Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A
					specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to
					its hatred and sorrow.<br>
					Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay,
					knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.
				</p>
				<h4>Poltergeist</h4>
				<p>
					A poltergeist is a different kind of specter—the confused, invisible spirit of an individual with no sense of how they died. A poltergeist expresses its rage by hurling creatures and objects
					using the power of its shattered psyche.
				</p>
				<h2 id="shadow">Shadow</h2>
				<p>
					Shadows are undead that resemble dark exaggerations of humanoid shadows. From the darkness, the shadow reaches out to feed on living creatures' vitality. They can consume any living creature, but
					they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the
					shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free,
					becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume. If a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might
					seek its "parent" to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.
				</p>
				<h2 id="stormwraith">Stormwraith</h2>
				<p>
					Stormwraiths are lost souls of the people of Nendor, trapped and tormented by the raging Dragonsea. Stormwraiths number in the tens of thousands, but few are ever encountered. They will
					occationally be ejected by storms and blown inland, where they go about sharing their torment with any creature unfortunate enough to cross their path. A person slain by a stormwraith may find
					itself tied to this world by the painful and violent death, and themselves rise as a specter to continue spreading the violence of the dragonsea.
				</p>
				<h2 id="willowisp">Will-o'-Wisp</h2>
				<p>
					Will-o'-wisps are malevolent, wispy balls of light that haunt lonely places and battlefields, bound by dark fate or dark magic to feed on fear and despair. Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing lantern
					lights in the distance, although they can choose to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that
					follow them. Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and revel in their death
					screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering flame.
				</p>
				<p>
					Will-o'-wisps rarely speak, but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with
					their wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover
					above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life goes out in a creature's eyes
				</p>
				<h2 id="wraith">Wraith</h2>
				<p>
					A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves
					nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with
					negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith—a
					malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life. A wraith might retain
					a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might
					pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what
					they were as a reminder of what they have become.
				</p>
				<p>
					A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.
					Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies
					are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.

					<h2>Ghoul</h2>
				</summary>
					<p>
						Ghouls roam the night in packs, driven by an insatiable hunger for humanoid flesh. Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place
						where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can't feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from
						the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul's undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold
						ages without feeding.<br>
						Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon
						Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other
						servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for
						salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls' paralytic touch.
					</p>
					<h4>Ghast</h4>
					<p>
						Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast. Whereas ghouls are little more than savage beasts, a ghast is cunning and can inspire a pack of ghouls
						to follow its commands.

					<h2>Gibbering Mouther</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Of all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims.
					Driven to insanity by the destruction of their bodies and absorption into the mouther, those victims gibber incoherent madness, forced to consume everything in reach. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The gibbering mouther's body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves
					slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease. When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or
					ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand
					paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living
					flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee. A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind.
					However, even as the last of a victim's body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster's next meal.

				<summary>
					<h2>Golems</h2>
					<p>Golems are made from humble materials—clay, flesh and bones, iron, stone etc.-but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain,
						and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.</p>
				</summary>
				<p>
					To create a golem, one requires a <i class="vryrmagit">Manual of Golems</i> (see List of Magic Items on the Items page). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the
					process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br>
					The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the
					master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work. After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem's creator
					infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the
					spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.<br>
					Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and
					ignoring all but the most potent spells. A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead
					can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br>
					When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the
					best of its ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them. A
					golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.
				</p>
				<h4>Clay Golem</h4>
				<p>
					Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller than most human-sized creatures. It is human shaped, but its proportions are off. Clay golems are often divinely endowed with
					purpose by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. If the golem is damaged, the elemental spirit bound into it can break free. Such a golem runs amok, smashing
					everything around it until it is destroyed or completely repaired.
				</p>
				<h4>Flesh Golem</h4>
				<p>
					A flesh golem is a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. Its brain is capable of simple reason, though its
					thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning, invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful
					enchantments protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent weapons. A flesh golem lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of its body. Its dead
					flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit breaks free of its creator's will, the golem goes berserk until
					calmed, or until its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.
				</p>
				<h4>Iron Golem</h4>
				<p>
					The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem's shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant
					suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can
					belch clouds of deadly poison. An iron golem's body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental
					spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the
					strength of adamantine.
				</p>
				<h4>Stone Golem</h4>
				<p>
					Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form
					the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts. Like other golems, stone golems are nearly
					impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.

					<h2>Grick</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The wormlike grick waits unseen, blending in with the rock of the caves and caverns it haunts. Only when prey comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal its hungry,
					snapping beak. Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows,
					holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling a round stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest
					prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes a round their lairs. When prey is scarce in the
					Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others
					congregate. Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs. Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the
					routes leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then claim the wealth of the foul creatures' victims.

				<summary>
					<h2>Griffin</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Griffins are ferocious avian carnivores with the muscular bodies of lions and the head, forelegs, and wings of eagles. When they attack, griffins are as swift deadly as eagles, even as they
					strike with a lion's might and grace. Griffins hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above
					all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffin screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey. Those riding or herding horses
					dread the griffin's piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffin ignores a horse's rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a
					herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffin targets its chosen prey. Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking
					griffin.<br>
					Griffins lair in high rocky clifftop. aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffins establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food
					supply has been exhausted. Aggressive and territorial, griffins engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling
					to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffin's lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.<br>
					A griffin raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert
					trainers well versed in the griffin's legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely. Once trained, a griffin is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one
					master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffin mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffin remains satiated with other
					prey when passing through civilized lands.

				<summary>
					<h2>Hags</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Hags are crones who represent corruption of ideals and goals, and they delight in seeing the innocent and good brought low. They are inhuman monsters, their forms twisted by evil. Shapechangers
					and blasphemers, they ally with other hags to form magical covens with extra powers. They collect and remember secret knowledge that is better lost and forgotten. Desperate mortals come to them
					looking for advice, only to have their requests fulfilled in ways that bring great suffering to themselves and their loved ones. Hags are mysterious, unfathomable, and dangerous, especially from
					the viewpoint of mortals. One day a hag might be stealing and eating children that wander into the woods, on another day she might be making lewd jokes to adventurers asking her for advice, and
					the next she might be uprooting saplings to make a fence around her home for impaling intruders. It is nearly impossible to predict how a hag will act from day to day, sometimes moment to moment,
					which is why folk with any wisdom at all give hags a wide berth. Hags perceive ugliness as beauty, and vice versa. They revel in having a hideous appearance and sometimes go out of their way to
					"improve" upon it by picking at sores, wearing skins and bones as decoration, and rubbing refuse and dirt into their hair and clothing. Because both the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court
					appreciate and revere true beauty among the fey, hags are almost never found in either place. The Summer Queen and the Queen of Air and Darkness recognize that hags have valuable knowledge and
					impressive magic, but they can't abide the stain on the beauty of their surroundings, so most hags are excluded from both courts. The rare few accepted as courtiers are either so influential that
					their entry can't be refused, or young and humble enough to be willing to use magic to put on a prettier appearance. Other hags aren't upset by their exclusion; they like to be left alone to
					their own schemes, not constrained by a fey queen's whims, and to be able to talk out of both sides of their mouths. Hags are virtually immortal, with a life span greater than that of even
					dragons and elves. The oldest, wisest, and most powerful hags are called "grandmothers" by other hags. Some grandmothers are nearly as powerful as some of the archfey. Hags of lower but still
					respectable status are called "aunties." An auntie gains her status from being very old, a member of a powerful coven, directly serving a grandmother, or having many offspring (whether adopted
					or birthed). 
				</p>
				<h4>Master Manipulators</h4>
				<p>
					Hags delight in corrupting others. They do so not by imposing their will or being outwardly violent, but by making sinister bargains with those who seek their aid. This desire to orchestrate the
					downfall of others is why so many hags make their homes near humanoid settlements, which gives them a ready supply of creatures to tantalize and torment. Folk with nowhere else to turn are some
					of a hag's best customers. A farmer with a philandering spouse might seek out the local hag for a potion to make the spouse faithful again. The mayor with a demented father might ask the hag for
					something that makes him lucid again. A merchant whose child is deathly ill might go to the hag for a cure. The common element in these situations is that the mortals approach the hag for help; 
					despite knowing that she is evil and dangerous, they are desperate enough to risk making a bargain with her, or foolish enough to think they can persuade her to be helpful without getting
					something in return. Hags make bargains differently from how devils operate. A devil might approach a mortal to make a deal because it wants the individual to become tainted with evil, so that
					when the victim dies its soul goes to the Nine Hells. Hags are usually content to wait and conduct their own business, allowing mortals to come to them when the perceived need is great enough.
					Instead of being interested in a mortal's soul, a hag wants to bring the mortal low during its life as compensation for fulfilling her end of the bargain. Devils barter with the soul as the
					commodity; hags barter because they enjoy making people miserable. Night hags, as fey turned fiends, use aspects of both methods-corrupting a mortal's dreams until the creature commits enough
					evil acts that she can claim its soul.<br>
					As much as she enjoys offering and enforcing her bargains, a hag rarely goes out looking for people to make deals with because she knows that someone coming to her puts her in a position of
					power. The visitor likely had to approach the hag in secret for fear of causing an uproar in town, and is probably eager to return home before being missed, which adds time pressure to the 
					process and tips the balance more in the hag's favor. All these factors contribute to the hag's being able to set her terms for the bargain, presenting an offer that appears reasonable, and
					perhaps seems to have a tempting loophole or two that the mortal could exploit. Hags understand mortal desires and vices, and know how to manipulate people by preying on those qualities. A hag's
					bargain might bring success and prosperity for a time, but eventually have a drawback or side effect that makes the mortal resent the agreement and seek to get out of it. The philandering spouse
					now happy to stay home might grow slothful, the mayor's father might turn violent after regaining his senses, and the merchant's child might relapse if not treated again every few months. Even
					when a bargain turns sour for a mortal and other people in town hear about or see the person's misfortune, the hag will eventually attract new customers. Other people will come to believe that
					they can outsmart the hag, or that their need is simple and can't be per￾verted, or that the earlier victims got too greedy when they were proposing a deal. Even if only one or two people make
					deals with a hag every year, over time many unfortunates can come under her sway-and she remembers the exact terms of every one of those bargains.
				</p>
				<h4>Bargainer Beware</h4>
				<p>
					Although it could be argued that there's no good time to make a bargain with a hag, mortals are more likely to get away in good shape if they offer up something a hag needs or wants. In such a
					case, the hag might even start the bidding. A hag that faces a serious threat from enemies will not hesitate to use promises or bribes to defuse the situation. For instance, most treasures in a
					hag's lair are useless without her knowledge of how to identify and handle them, so she might offer to provide such information in return for her life. If an item later backfires on the one who
					uses it, or turns out to be cursed in some way, that's just another lesson in why never to never threaten or trust a hag. Hags are curious about other creatures of power. They enjoy receiving
					news and gossip about other hags and influential creatures such as dragons, demons, genies, and certain mortals. Offering a hag accurate information of this sort as part of a bargain earns a
					small measure of her respect, and might make her more receptive to the idea of a "fair" deal. When a hag bargains with other creatures of the Feywild, rather than mortals, she approaches the
					situation with a more respectful attitude. She realizes that the creatures of her native realm are more powerful than common humanoids and therefore more dangerous when disappointed or angered
					by a deal gone bad. Fey are also long-lived and thus have more time to retaliate against the hag, whereas most humanoids die within a few short decades. These considerations don't mean that hags
					are automatically pleasant in dealings with other fey, just that they aren't as blatant or demanding in the bargains they offer; hags know exactly how much they can get away with, and they like
					pushing the limits of what others will tolerate.<br>
					When a hag is generous with her help or requires only a simple task as payment, that's no guarantee that the deal will turn out as expected for both parties. By offering a proposal that seems,
					or actually is, fair, chances are that the hag is pursuing a hidden agenda. She still wants to set events into motion that benefit her or bring about the downfall of another, but she does so in
					an indirect way that has no obvious connection to her. A bargain as simple as a villager agreeing to deliver a mysterious letter at a crossroads at noon on a certain day could be the key to
					ruining the mortal's life. The hag's reasons might not become apparent for years or even decades, or won't be meaningful except under specific circumstances, such as an auspicious birth or a
					climactic encounter with a dangerous villain. Even when she's offering a deal that seems to have no downside, a hag is always secretive about her motivations, the reasons for the payments she 
					requires, or how these things benefit her. A hag that spends a long time in close proximity to a human settlement often depletes the community of good-hearted folk as they succumb to her evil and
					selfish plans. The mood of the town becomes unwelcoming, grim, moody, or outright hostile toward newcomers and travelers. Even after a hag has done her worst in such a place, she maintains
					leverage over her victims by holding out the prospect that someday she will undo the curses that she has lain on them. For that reason, the local leaders won't allow any outsiders to act against
					her (which includes sabotaging adventurers who might decide to confront her). 
				</p>
				<h4>Welcome to the Family</h4>
				<p>
					Hags make more hags by snatching and devouring human infants, birthing daughters who turn into hags on entering the thirteenth year of their lives. Fortunately for humanity and the rest of the
					world, such an occurrence is rare. Rarer still, but not unheard of, is for a hag to repeat this process twice or more in short succession, giving her multiple offspring of about the same age.
					She might do this to form a coven with two of her daughters, or to create a coven made up entirely of her offspring. Some hags cite ancient lore that suggests that if a hag consumes twins or
					triplets, her offspring might have additional, unusual abilities; similarly, devouring the seventh-born child of a seventh-born is said to be a way to pass on rare magic to the hag's daughter. 
				</p>
				<h4>Roleplaying a Hag</h4>
				<p>
					Even when a hag acts indifferently or friendly toward adventurers, inside she is still a twisted fey creature, and she doesn't give two coppers about what anyone else thinks or wants. She might
					casually comment about how easily a visitor would fit in her cauldron or make a blunt sexual comment about a guest. When a mortal visits a hag, the experience should be nerve-wracking,
					uncomfortable, and risky; at any point the hag might lose her temper and decide to pull out someone's fingernails with her iron teeth. Hags look upon younger creatures from the perspective of a
					cantankerous grandparent who no longer cares what anyone thinks—set in her ways, free to speak her mind, and not afraid to bring down punishment if pushed too far. Hags enjoy meddling with other
					people's lives, like busybodies with cruel intentions. Any time a hag agrees to help someone, the bargain includes a price to be paid, plus a hidden plan by which she sets the mortal up to fail,
					or a way that she gains leverage (whether over the deal-maker or someone else). When a hag is presented with an unusual spell, a rare magic item, or a person who has a strange magical gift, she
					will sniff it, shake it, listen to it, taste it, murmur odd statements to herself, and mentally place a value on the merchandise. Hags aren't subtle about showing their intent at such times, and
					one might snatch away the offering so she can examine it more closely, even if this makes it obvious she is interested. If she doesn't have anything else like it, or can think of a use for it, or
					if having it means a rival can't get her hands on it, she'll value the offering highly. A visitor who offers a desirable item as a bribe or a gift is more likely to get a fair deal from the hag,
					or at least likely to suffer less when the true price of the deal is revealed. If a hag's life is threatened, she will pretend to be weak and helpless if she thinks it will spare her life or buy
					her time to retaliate or escape. She'll use dangerous treasures as bribes, not telling about their curses or side effects. She will lie and deceive and try to turn her enemies against each other,
					playing up their guilt and fear and jealousy to tear them apart from the inside. She is older, smarter, and more shrewd than any mortal who dares to threaten her. Hags prefer to cajole and
					bargain rather than confront someone with actual violence; they reserve their aggressive outbursts for situations where they are overwhelmingly more powerful than their opponents (such as when
					attacking children) or have an unfair advantage (such as when their enemy is asleep). Although a hag can always resort to attacking with her claws, if it comes to that then something has gone
					very wrong with her plans. 
				</p>
				<h4>Hag Names</h4>
				<p>
					Hags have whimsical names, often with a dark twist. A hag gives her newborn daughter a name that the girl keeps during her childhood, but upon gaining her full hag powers the daughter chooses
					her own name, which might or might not relate to her birth name. Some hags use different names in different guises, but still prefer their original name as their favorite. Hags always have a
					title followed by a first name (eg. "Auntie Ethel"), or a first name followed by a last name (eg. "Peggy Toestealer").

				<h4>Weird Magic</h4>
				<p>
					Over the course of a seemingly endless lifetime, a hag typically discovers or creates several unusual ways to use magic. The weird magic that hags can call upon comes in a number of forms and
					with various means of activation. Even those who have read scholarly books about hag lore can't predict what a particular hag might have up her sleeve. A grandmother or some other hag of great
					age and renown might know unique rituals that can temporarily or permanently alter or transform a creature, bring back the dead for a limited time, rewrite memories, or siphon emotions. At the
					other end of the spectrum, even a hag without lofty status is likely to have strange, single-use items that don't emulate common spells or even follow the normal rules of magic. For inspiration
					in devising the effects of such weird items, see <a href="../pg/other.html">"Other Rewards" on the Other Rules page</a>. If you want a hag to use a weird object of this sort in a combat
					situation, provide her with an item that produces a CR-appropriate spell effect when the hag manipulates or activates it. The effect might be a benefit to herself or an attack against her
					enemies. For example, a green hag (CR 3) might smash an ornate hand mirror, producing a cloud of glass shards that damages creatures like <a href="../pg/spells.html?l="><i>Cloud of Daggers</i></a>
					(a 2nd-level spell). She might instead uncork a bottle of wasps that surround her and stitch up her wounds with their stingers, healing her as
					<a href="../pg/spells.html?l=CureWounds"><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> (cast as a 2nd-level spell). Or she could take a mummified toad from her pocket and throw it into her cauldron, which immediately
					spews out inky blackness equivalent to <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=Darkness"><i>Darkness</i></a> (a 2nd-level spell). A hag carefully shepherds her use of weird magic because the items in her
					repertoire are often impossible to duplicate or replace. To reflect this fact, a hag should be able to use weird magic only once or twice per encounter in her lair, or only once per encounter if
					she is elsewhere. A hag who is expecting a fight might be better prepared and able (or willing) to use weird magic one additional time per encounter. If a hag is faced with mortal peril, all
					thoughts of con￾serving her resources vanish—she will use any weird magic at her disposal if it helps her stay alive. After all, a hag that's not dead has a virtually limitless lifetime to
					replace what was spent. No matter how hard it was to acquire that jar of death slugs, or that book on how to invoke the razor wind, or the runestone containing the three syllables for
					crystallizing blood, it is better to use such things than to risk death by not doing so. 
				</p>
				<h4>Mounts an Vehicles</h4>
				<p>
					Many stories tell of hags using strange, enchanted creatures and objects for travel, and most of those stories are accurate. Instead of the usual horse or pony, a hag might ride astride a giant
					pig, a goat, or a cow. It's not unknown for a hag to use a sentient creature as a mount, perhaps as the result of a bargain that creature struck with her. A hag that wants to humiliate a mortal
					hero might require that hero to serve as her mount for a year as part of fulfilling her bargain. The giant raven that carries a hag aloft could be in actuality one of the hag's victims
					transformed because that individual tried to go back on its deal with her. Some hags prefer nonliving conveyances from time to time, and their imagination in this regard knows no bounds. A hag
					might happily animate and "spruce up" any sort of object she can tailor for the purpose, such as a clay statue, a huge woven basket, a cauldron, a butter churn, a giant bird's nest, a mortar and
					pestle, or a tombstone. Usually only the hag that obtained or created them can use her mounts and vehicles. They obey only her commands, and their magic responds only to her will. If a hag allows
					any other creature to use one of them as part of a bargain, she must be expecting an immense return on her investment.

				<h4 id="annishag">Annis Hag</h4>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Hag Metamorphosis</i></h4>
					<p>
						It's commonly believed that five kinds of hags exist in the world (and beyond it), Annis, Bheur, Green, Night, and Sea. What's not so widely known is that some hags can change from one kind
						to another during their lives. A hag that lives long enough or has the necessary resources can alter her basic nature, leaving behind her old physiology and adopting that of a hag appropriate
						to the environment of her current home. She might accomplish this transformation through force of will over Time, or faster with the help of a ritual or assistance from her coven. The
						reasons for making such a change are as varied as the personalities and goals of hags.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall. Although annis
					hags can easily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others. They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair
					often shows the signs of this industry. Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim. In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby
					villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than turning a vibrant community into a place paralyzed with terror, where folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with
					suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children to "be good, or the annis will get you."
				</p>
				<p>
					When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an <i class="comnmagit">Iron Token</i> that it
					can use to confide in her. Over time, "Granny" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds-starting with breaking things or wandering outside without permission,
					then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Sooner or later, the child's family and community become terrified of the "bad seed" and must face the awful
					decision of whether the child should be punished or exiled. Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls,
					or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition.

					<p>
						An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that 
						holds this <i class="comnmagit">Iron Token</i> can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of
						each other. The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token 
						and not the noise around it.<br>
						A hag can have up to three <i class="comnmagit">Iron Token</i> active at one time. As an action, she can discern the direction and approximate distance to all of her active tokens. She can
						instantaneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magical properties. 
					</p>
				</details>
				<h4 id="bheurhag">Bheur Hag</h4>
				<p>
					Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snow-covered mountains. They become more active during winter, us￾ing their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements. A bheur
					hag's skin is blue-white, like that of a person who has frozen to death. Her hair is pale white, and she is emaciated, as if she were a person who had survived winter by eating bark and leather.
					Her eyes are pale and surrounded by dark, bruise-colored flesh. A bheur carries a twisted gray wooden staff, which she can ride like a flying broom and augments her magical powers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat, chopping down a <b>dryad's</b> grove for firewood, and so on. These actions
					are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas
					and thoughts in mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villagers against each other. A
					bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer and die for their mistakes during the winter. She is delighted when mortals make petty, pathetic attempts to survive, such as eating boots and
					leather scraps when no real food is to be found. When a bheur hag is fully in the throes of combat and has recently slain one of her foes, she often forgoes a direct attack on her remaining
					enemies and instead takes a moment to feed on the corpse, dismembering it and tearing meat from bone. The sight of this savagery is enough to render witnesses temporarily insane. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="greenhag">Green Hag</h4>
				<p>
					The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding,
					masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts. 
					Green hags revel in the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for whole nations. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="nighthag">Night Hag</h4>
				<p>
					Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous turn to villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness turned to hate, devotion to disregard, and generosity to selfishness. Night hags
					take perverse joy in corrupting mortals. Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but their foulness saw them exiled to Hades long ago, where they degenerated into fiends. The night hags
					have long since spread across the Lower Planes. While a humanoid sleeps, a night hag can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag's
					spectral form straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills her victim's head with doubts and fears, in the hope of tricking it into performing evil acts in the waking world. The hag continues her
					nightly visitations until the victim finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her victim to commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul in her <i class="vryrmagit">Soul Bag</i> for
					transport to Hades. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time
					and effort.

						When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A <i class="vryrmagit">Soul Bag</i> can hold

				<h4 id="seahag">Sea Hag</h4>
				<p>
					Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters. Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When confronted with something beautiful, the
					hag might simply attack it or deface it. If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear. Sea hags are by far
					the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although
					a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.

				<h4 id="duskhag">Dusk Hag</h4>
				<p>
					Dusk hags resemble gnarled crones with shriveled orange skin, tangled gray hair, and eyes that burn like hot coals. They see visions of the future in their dreams, and their dark magic allows
					them to influence the dreams of others, sending messages or inflicting nightmares with a touch. Tales talk of ambitious wizards, frantic monarchs, and desperate heroes undertaking quests or
					making bargains with a dusk hag in exchange for its prophecies and visions of the future. But the information gained from a dusk hag often has a way of causing more pain than joy. Like all hags,
					dusk hags enjoy causing strife to those who bargain with them, and find ways to twist and turn promises to their own advantage. The Dusk Hag Prophecies table provides examples of the sort of
					dreams dusk hags might share with unsuspecting sleepers. Dusk hags are native to the world of eberron, and are not part of the normal continuum of hags nor usually encountered on other worlds.
				</p>
				<h4>Solitary but Social</h4>
				<p>
					Hags are selfish by nature, and each one cherishes her independence—from the rest of the world as well as from other hags. At the same time, every hag recognizes that she and her sisters are
					kindred souls, like the members of a dark sorority or sisterhood. Even though hags don't like each other, they share knowledge and trade secrets, helping them to keep abreast of worldly events
					and possible dangers. Even a hag living in a remote, isolated location is aware of goings-on that involve her neighboring hags, whether through magical communication, personal visits, or mundane
					messengers such as birds. In most cases, these relationships with her sisters, though devoid of emotion, are the closest a hag comes to having friends. When a hag is attacked or killed, other
					hags are likely to hear about it. If the victim was friendly with other hags, those responsible for her death might find themselves the target of retaliation. If the victim died while owing
					favors to another hag, that hag sees her killers as now responsible for the dead hag's debts. If the victim was unpopular or if other hags were indebted to her (and thus are happy to see her go),
					her killers might receive relatively cordial treatment from those other hags instead. Every hag has a particular status relative to others of her kind and to hags of all sorts, based on age,
					abilities, influence, alliances, and experience, and is aware of her place (though not necessarily satisfied with it). The few grandmothers sit at the top of the hierarchy, a larger number of
					aunties are beneath that, and all other hags vie for prominence in a chaotic pecking order that no mortal can truly figure out. A hag that is known to associate with an auntie has a higher status
					than a similarly powerful hag without such a connection, and a young hag born of a grandmother begins her existence already benefiting from a greater measure of respect and status. 
				</p>
				<h2 class="hagcovens">Hag Covens</h2>
				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>The Rule of Three</i></h4>
					<p>
						They say that things come in threes. Good things. Bad things. Strange things. Hags and purveyors of witchcraft embrace the Rule of Three, as it is called: a coven has three members, they
						believe that good or evil magic returns upon its source threefold, and the casting of many spells requires the same words chanted three times. Long ago, planar travelers came to recognize
						that many of the realms and layers of the multiverse are configured in multiples of three. It is possible that plane-traveling hags learned of this planar-based superstition and adapted it 
						to their own uses, although some among the oldest hags claim to have invented the concept or at least named it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					To a hag, the thought of sharing her home with other creatures—even other hags—is disgusting. She has nothing but dislike or disdain for anyone other than herself, and she loves being alone
					(except for the company of minions and other creatures under her sway). That's the ordinary state of affairs. But when a group of hags have a common goal or they seek greater power to combat a
					formidable threat, they suppress their basic nature and come together to do their work. The result is a coven. Being part of a coven gives each individual hag more magic and spellcasting ability,
					and to her these benefits offset the inconvenience and bickering that goes with living and working with other hags. If a member of a coven is killed and the surviving members intend to keep the
					group from dissolving, they immediately attempt to recruit a replacement. This process involves each prospective member committing cruel acts with the aim of impressing the remaining coven
					members. Adventurers who slay only one member of a coven might deal a blow to it in the short term, but later on the surrounding region is wracked with plaguest curses, and other disasters as
					the applicants attempt to outdo one another.An unusually gifted mortal sorcerer, warlock, or wizard of a deeply evil nature might be invited to join a coven or allowed to compete for a vacancy.
					This arrangement is potentially a dangerous proposition for the mortal, but a pair of hags might agree to it if their needs are served. For instance, a human member of a coven makes an ideal spy
					and infiltrator in and around a humanoid settlement. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i>Shared Spellcasting:</i></b> While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the spells from the wizard's spell list bleow, but must share
					the spell slots among themselves. For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's
					Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.

					Some covens gather for a specific purpose, such as to defeat a champion of good, to serve as oracles for the delivery of baleful prophecies, or to corrupt a pristine wilderness. In such a case,
					because the coven strives to bend its magic to a more directed purpose, the members have different spells available for use with their Shared Spellcasting trait, usually focusing on a theme

					A hag coven can also craft a magic item called a <i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i>, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The 
					<i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i> is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the <i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i> sees if the
					<i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i> is on the same plane of existence. A <i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i> has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
					coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours. A hag coven can have only one <i class="comnmagit">Hag Eye</i> at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of
					the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must
					start over.
				</p>
				<h2 id="haglairs">Hag Lairs</h2>
				<p>
					No matter what form it takes, a hag's home is a manifestation of her basic nature. It is ugly, eerie, or unnerving in some way, often incorporating some aspect of decay, such as a dead tree, a
					ruined tower, or a menacing cave entrance that resembles a skull. Whether naturally or by manufactured means, the lair is well defended from intrusion. It might be reachable only by a steep
					mountain path, or it might be surrounded by a fence the hag builds out of posts capped with magically warded skulls. Often, a lair reflects the outlook of its primary inhabitant—a murderous hag's
					home might be crafted to look like a coffin or a mausoleum, and that of a gluttonous one might look like a tavern or a gingerbread house. Because such places are convenient for them, sea hags
					often establish their lairs inside the hulls of wrecked or abandoned ships. A hag's home is cluttered with mundane items, caged creatures, oddities, objects that hint of a magical purpose,
					preserved specimens, scraps of lore, and curiosities that have a supernatural origin but aren't inherently magical. For a selection of strange hag treasures, see the One-of-a-Kind Objects table
					below.

					Many hags settle in places where the barriers between the mortal world and the Feywild are thin, making it easy for them to interact and bargain with creatures of both realms. Other popular
					choices are a place where the ambient energy augments certain kinds of magic, a site related to death such as a burial ground, and within a ring of fallen standing stones that still resonate
					with ancient power. In order to facilitate bargaining with mortals, the home must be near enough to a populated area that it attracts occasional visitors, but not so close that a community would
					see the hag's presence as a threat and try to defeat her or drive her off.
				</p>
				<p>
					A hag always has an escape plan, in case ambitious do-gooders try to turn her home into her final resting place. If she is outmatched, or wants to vacate her lair quickly for some other reason,
					she uses a mix of her innate spellcasting, rare magic, guile, and the assistance of minions to get away. Most hags have three plans prepared: one for general threats and two others for spe￾cific
					likely scenarios, such as "They've set the house on fire" or "A necromancer with undead are attacking." If a hag is forced to resort to such measures, she immediately begins to plot her
					retaliation against those that caused her to flee. Like a vampire or a demon, a hag has a long life over which to exact her vengeance, and no dish of revenge is sweeter than one served cold and
					to the next three generations of her enemy's family. 
				</p>
				<h4>Regional Effects</h4>
				<p>
					A hag's foul nature slowly suffuses the environment around her lair, twisting it to evil. Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie,
					or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC
					of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.<br>
					The region within 1 mile of a powerful hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li>
					<li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li>
					<li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Additionally, a hag's type determines some regional effects of her lair, as described below</p>
				<ul class="lairalt" style="width:31.6%;">
					<b>Annis Hag:</b>
					<li>The gravel stones on a safe-looking path, road, or trails occasionally become sharp for 100-foot intervals. Walking on these areas is like walking on caltrops.</li>
					<li>Small avalanches of rock intermittently fall, blocking a path or burying intruders. A buried creature is <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a> and has to hold its breath
						until it is dug out.</li>
					<li>Strange laughter, sounding like that of children or the hag herself, occasionally pierces the silence.</li>
					<li>Small cairns appear along the route of travelers, con￾taining anything from mysterious bones to nothing at all. These cairns might be haunted by
						<a href="./monsters.html?l=Skeleton"><b>skeletons</b></a>, <a href="./monsters.html?l=Specter"><b>specters</b></a>, or hostile fey.</li>
				</ul><ul class="lairalt" style="width:31.6%;">
					<b>Bheur Hag:</b>
					<li>Small avalanches of snow intermittently fall, blocking a path or burying intruders. A buried creature is <a href="../pg/combat.html?f=Restrained">restrained</a> and has to hold its breath until it is dug out.</li>
					<li>Human-sized blocks of ice appear, containing frozen corpses. These corpses might break free and attack as <a href="./monsters.html?l=Zombie"><b>zombies</b></a>, or their spirits might attack
						as <a href="./monsters.html?l=Specter"><b>specters</b></a>.</li>
					<li>Blizzards come without warning. A blizzard occurs once every 2d12 hours and lasts 1d3 hours. During a storm, creatures moving overland travel at half normal speed, and normal visibility is
						reduced to 30 feet.</li>
					<li>Roads, paths, and trails twist and turn back on themselves, making navigation in the area exceedingly difficult.</li>
				</ul><ul class="lairalt" style="width:31.6%;">
					<b>Green Hag:</b>
					<li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves
						like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the
						illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.</li>
					<li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twfsted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>
					<li>Trees transform into <a href="./monsters.html?l=AwakenedTree"><b>awakened trees</b></a> and attack when hostile intruders are near.</li>
				</ul><ul class="lairalt" style="width:31.6%;">
					<b>Night Hag:</b>
					<li>Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as though alive.</li>
					<li>Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a minute or two, and then returned to
						the place where they vanished from.</li>
					<li>Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves littering the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to
						disappear.</li>
				</ul><ul class="lairalt" style="width:31.6%;">
					<b>Sea Hag:</b>
					<li>Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.</li>
					<li>Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these waters has disadvantage.</li>
					<li>Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish. The hag can sense when one of the fish is handled and cause it to speak with her voice.</li>
				</ul>

					Although they are solitary by nature, hags sometimes feel the need for companionship. Usually one scratches this itch by acquiring servants she can insult and slap around as she wishes. Such a
					creature might be charmed into compliance, or under a spell that stops its heart if it disobeys, or too afraid of nonmagical punishment for failure to do what she says. Most hags have some kind
					of slave or minion creature living with or near them as a defense against attackers, even if it's just a common animal. Hags particularly delight in using mortals bound to their service as
					minions. A paladin might have no qualms about putting a hag coven to the sword, but her conviction falters if she must first fight through a crowd of innocent farmers that the hags have
					compelled to defend them. Ordinary folk are also useful as minions because they can serve the hag as her eyes and ears in a nearby settlement, either operating secretly or actively trying to
					persuade other townsfolk to pay her a visit. The weird magic at a hag's disposal means that she might have almost any type of creature helping or serving her—fey, giant, undead, and so on. Even
					a creature much more powerful than she might be under her command, working off the debt of a bargain for itself or someone else. Favors beget favors, and under duress a hag might speak a magic
					word to call upon a blood debt from a dragon, a noble, or another hag, making her able to wield magical, political, or physical power in a way she can't do by herself. Like the land near a hag's
					lair, over time her minions are altered by her presence, becoming twisted versions of their former selves (in a dark fey sort of way), but still recognizable as what they once were. She might
					alter them with magic, making them tireless, resistant to fire, able to transform into a flock of crows, or able to teleport through shadows—whatever the hag thinks best defends or serves her. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To determine the minions and helpers in a hag's retinue, roll once on the following tables or choose from the possibilities. The Servants table includes faithful, trusted helpers that a hag uses
					to protect herself and her home. These creatures are either naturally wicked or warped by the hag to better serve her. In either case, a hag is confident that her servants will obey her orders
					without question. The Brutes table gives examples of the muscle a hag might employ, mercenaries that serve the hag only so long as it benefits them. These creatures run errands and take care of
					roughing up enemies or patrolling areas that the hag considers beneath her personal attention. Hags prefer to employ clever, cruel creatures rather than dumb oafs.

					Above and beyond the items of obvious value a hag has accumulated, she also has a few bizarre and unique items in her collection. The One-of-a-Kind Objects table provides a way to quickly add
					such weird items to a hag's home. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of a hag's treasure is strewn among all the clutter in her lair, making it difficult for intruders to quickly identify all the items that have use or value. But the hag knows what, and
					where, everything is. Every hag is infallible when it comes to keeping track of her treasures and other possessions. Her organization and labeling, if such a system exists, is designed to foil
					thieves and serve as a final, vexing puzzle for anyone who tries to make use of an item without her consent. A hag's treasure—like a gift from a fey being—should be doubted and even feared
					rather than simply being scooped up and carted away. Treasure-seekers are likely to fare better if they consider a hag's booty to be trapped, exercising caution rather than giving in to greed or
					curiosity. Manipulating a container or other item without knowing what's inside or what it does (or without knowing the proper password or technique) is likely to be very dangerous. At best,
					whatever was held in a container merely escapes or dissipates. At worst, just about anything can happen, none of it good.

				<summary>
					<h2>Harpy</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill
					and then consume. A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human. Its wicked talons and bone club make it a formidable threat in combat, and its
					eyes reflect the absolute evil of its soul.
				</p>
				<p>
					To hear a harpy's song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its
					source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or
					incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath. Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and
					they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat. When they
					attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the "music" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before
					the merciful end.
				</p>
				<p>
					Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be
					found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden in remote r'uins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul
					piles of offal.

					<h2>Homonculus</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Shaping a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, and blood, one can channel rare ritual magic to create a faithful, squirrel-sized companion. A homunculus is a construct that acts as an extension of
					its creator, with the two sharing thoughts, senses, and language through a mystical bond. A master can have only one homunculus at a time (attempts to create another one always fail), and when its
					master dies, the homunculus also dies.
				</p>
				<p>
					A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great
					distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation
					or adventuring.

			<details id="hydra">
				<summary>
					<h2>Hydra</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The hydra is a reptilian horror with a crocodilian body and multiple heads on long, serpentine necks. Although its heads can be severed, the hydra magically regrows them in short order. A typical
					specimen has five heads. At the dawn of time, Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, slew a rival dragon god named Lernaea and cast her blood across the multiverse. Each drop that fell upon a world
					spawned a multi-headed hydra consumed by a hunger as great as the fallen god's hatred. Great champions are known to test their mettle against these fearsome creatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					A rapacious and gluttonous monster, a hydra snatches and tears apart its prey in a frenzy of feeding. During their early years, hydras feed their rapid growth by terrorizing the land. When they
					grow large enough, they look for a territory to claim as their own. Often, they steal lairs from other monsters in prolonged, devastating battles. Hydras are natural swimmers, dwelling in rivers,
					along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. Soon after a hydra claims a territory, it typically buries itself, entering a period of hibernation during which it continues to grow.
					When it awakens, it goes on a feeding rampage, so beginning the cycle once again. When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by
					surprise.
				</p>
				<h4>Polukranos, the World-Eater of Theros</h4>
				<p>
					What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the
					multiverse to massive mostrous hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses. Beyond even these exist serpentine horrors born of the whims of foul gods, like the legendary hydra Polukranos.
				</p>
				<p>
					Polukranos, called the World Eater, is the mortal manifestation of the eternal ideal of a hydra. In its first incarnation, it fell from Nyx to the mortal world, and so great were its size an
					strength that the gods Nylea and Heliod combined their power to bind the monster deep within the Nessian Wood. That incarnation was slain, but the eternal ideal remains. A new incarnation of the
					World Eater is a fearsome omen, as the monster only appears when the pillars of the world tremble and terrible things are afoot in the realm of the gods. Its rampages often presage an age of
					menace for all civilization.

					<h2>Incarnation of Creation</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Embodying the primordial forces which created life, incarnations of creation come in nearly all shapes and sizes. Most commonly they are found as small, silvery otters which flit about playfully,
					but in a flash they are capable of becoming some of the world's most dangerous creatures if the situation requires it. Many a wizard who has devoted their life to the study of transmutation has
					wished for but a small piece of the power such creatures wield, but their mercurial nature makes them impossible to study. Many who encounter incarnations of creation walk away confused, for the
					creature seems to work off an agenda only discernible to itself. And, thanks to the incarnation's shapechanging nature, most individuals who encounter these celestials indeed do not even realize
					they do, as the incarnation appears before them as something else entirely.

				<summary>
					<h2>Korred</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Korreds are unpredictable, secretive fey with strong ties to earth and stone. Because of their magical hair and their mystical understanding of minerals, they are sought after by
					treasure-hunters, dwarves, and others that desire wealth beneath the earth. Korreds prefer to keep their own company and occasionally consort with creatures of elemental earth such as galeb duhr.
					A tribe of korreds gathers weekly to perform ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. In the depths of the Material Plane, korreds typically flee from other
					creatures but become aggressive when they feel insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining. 
				</p>
				<p>
					No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than a korred. Korreds can seemingly smell veins of metal or gems. A korred on the surface can feel the rise and fall of bedrock under the earth
					and where caves lie, and underground it knows the pathways through the stone for miles. Secret doors that lead through stone are as obvious as windows to a korred. Korreds can hurl boulders far
					larger than it seems they should be able to, shape stone as though it were clay, swim through rock, and summon earth elementals and other creatures. They also gain supernatural strength just from
					standing on the ground. Korreds have hair all over their bodies, but the hair that grows from their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into whatever material was used to cut it. Korreds
					use iron shears to cut lengths of their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron ropes that they can manipulate, animating them to bind or snake around creatures and objects. Korreds
					take great pride in their hair, and equally great offense at anyone who attempts to cut it without permission.

			<details id="kraken">
				<summary>
					<h2>Kraken</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Beneath the waves, the kraken sleeps for untold ages, waiting some fell sign or calling. Land-born mortals who sail the open sea forget the reasons their ancestors dreaded the ocean, even as the
					races of the deep ignore strange gaps in their histories when their civilizations nearly vanished after the appearance of the tentacled horror. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of time, krakens served as fierce warriors of the gods. When the gods' wars ended, the krakens shrugged free of their servitude, never again to be bound by other beings. Whole
					nations quake in fear when the kraken emerges from its dark demesne, and even in the middle of the deepest oceans, storms rise or abate according to its will. The kraken is a primeval force that
					obliterates the greatest achievements of civilization as if they were castles in the sand. Its devastating attacks can destroy ocean trade and halt communication between coastal cities. An
					ominous darkness presages a kraken's attack, and a cloud of inky poison colors the water around it. Galleons and warships vanish when its tentacles uncoil from the deep, the kraken breaking their
					masts like kindling before drawing down ships and crew. Not even landlocked surface dwellers are safe from a kraken's wrath. Krakens can breathe air as easily as water, and some crawl up rivers
					to nest in freshwater lakes, destroying cities and towns along the way. Adventurers tell of these monsters lairing in the ruins of lakeside citadels, their tentacles twined around leaning towers
					of disintegrating stone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some krakens are virtual gods, with cults and minions spread across sea and land. Others are allied with Olhydra, the evil Princess of Elemental Water, and use her cultists to enforce their will
					on land and sea. A kraken pleased with its worshipers can becalm rough seas and bring a bounteous harvest of fish to the faithful. However, the devious mind of a kraken is ancient beyond
					reckoning, and is ultimately bent to the ruination of all things. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="krakenlair">A Kraken's Lair</h4>
				<p>
					A kraken lives in dark depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus, treasure, and wrecked ships. The region containing a kraken's lair is warped by the creature's blasphemous
					presence, creating the following magical effects:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The kraken can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the <i>Control Weather</i> spell.</li>
					<li>Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (-5). </li>
					<li>Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the kraken and aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When the kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately.

			<details id="lich">
				<summary><h2>Lich</h2></summary>
				<p>
					Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except
					where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them,
					they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition. A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes
					succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time. No
					wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul 
					entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their
					knowledge. A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes
					after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, 
					immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver. With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation—a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient
					creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains. Liches collect spells and
					magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spell books, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about
					putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack. From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it,
					most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair. Few liches call
					themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King. 
				</p><h4>The Phylactery</h4><p>
					When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's
					phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in
					a hidden, well-guarded location. Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its 
					destruction can be a quest in and of itself. A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the
					<a href="../pg/spells.html?l=Imprisonment"><i>Imprisonment</i></a> spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body
					and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a
					<a href="../pg/spells.html?l=DispelMagic"><i>Dispel Magic</i></a> cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery
					for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life. A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls
					begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a <b>demilich</b>.
				</p>
				<h4>A Lich's Lair</h4>
				<p>
					A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful
					guardians and traps. Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in
					shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.
				</p>
				<h2 id="demilich">Demilich</h2>
				<p>
					The immortality granted to a lich lasts only as long as it feeds mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails in that task, its bones turn to dust until only its skull remains. This
					"demilich" contains only a fragment of the lich's malevolent life force- just enough so that if it is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume a wraithlike form. The skull then
					emits a terrifying howl that can slay the weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear. Left alone, it sinks back down and returns to the empty peace of its existence. Few liches seek to
					become demiliches, for it means an end to the existence they hoped to preserve by becoming undead. However, time can erode the lich's reason and memory, causing it to retreat into its ancient
					tomb and forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane energy it wielded as a lich. However, even as a mere skull it remains a deadly
					and vexing enemy. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Even after a lich is reduced to a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its phylactery is intact, the demilich can't be permanently destroyed. Its skull reforms after 1d10 days,
					restoring the creature to its wretched state. If it has the presence of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim its former power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing so restores the
					demilich to lich form, reconstituting its undead body. So great is a demilich's will to survive that it always has the maximum number of hit points for its Hit Dice, instead of average hit
					points.
				</p>
				<p>
					The transformation into a demilich isn't a bitter end for all liches that experience it. Made as a conscious choice, the path of the demilich becomes the next step in a dark evolution. The lich
					Acererak—a powerful wizard and demonologist and the infamous master of the Tomb of Horrors—anticipated his own transformation, preparing for it by setting enchanted gemstones into his skull's eye
					sockets and teeth. Each of these soul gems possessed the power to capture the souls on which his phylactery would feed. Acererak abandoned his physical body, accepting that it would molder and
					dissolve to dust while he traveled the planes as a disembodied consciousness. If the skull that was his last physical remains was ever disturbed, its gems would claim the souls of the insolent
					intruders to his tomb, magically transferring them to his phylactery. Liches who follow Acererak's path believe that by becoming free of their bodies, they can continue their quest for power
					beyond the mortal world. As their patron did, they secure their remains within well-guarded vaults, using soul gems to maintain their phylacteries and destroy the adventurers who disturb their
					lairs. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="demilichlair"></h4>
				<p>
					A demilich hides its earthly remains and treasures in a labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters and traps. At the heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and the dust from its other
					bones. A demilich's tomb might have any or all of the following effects in place: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb's area, the creature takes 3d10 necrotic damage.</li>
					<li>Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and against features that turn undead. </li>
					<li>The tomb is warded against the magical travel of creatures the demilich hasn't authorized. Such creatures can't teleport into or out of the tomb's area or use planar travel to enter or leave
						it. Effects that allow teleportation or planar travel work within the tomb as long as they aren't used to leave or enter the tomb's area.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of 10 days.</p>

				<summary>
					 <h2>Lycanthropes</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy
					appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal
					animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark. Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to
					spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from
					villages and towns.<br>
					A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A <i>Remove Curse</i> spell can rid an
					afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish. A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a
					lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon
					rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the
					beast within can be controlled onc again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt
					a lycanthrope as bloody dreams. Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and
					can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.

				<div class="notes" style="float:right">
					<h4><i>Variant: Nonhuman Lycanthropes</i></h4>
					<p>
						The statistics presented on the Monsters page assume a base creature of human. However, you can also use the statistics to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude by allowing a
						nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might have the Fey Ancestry trait.

				</div>
				<h4 id="werebear">Werebear</h4>
				<p>
					Werebears are powerful lycanthropes with the ability to temper their monstrous natures and reject their violent impulses. In humanoid form, they are large, muscular, and covered in hair matching
					the color of their ursine form's fur. A were bear is a loner by nature, fearing what might happen to innocent creatures around it when its bestial nature takes over. When a werebear transforms,
					it grows to enormous size, lashing out with weapons or claws. It fights with the ferocity of a bear, though even in its bestial forms, it avoids biting so as to not pass on its curse. Typically,
					a werebear passes on its lycanthropy only to chosen companions or apprentices, spending the time that follows helping the new lycanthrope accept the curse in order to control it. Solitary
					creatures, werebears act as wardens over their territory, protecting flora and fauna alike from humanoid or monstrous intrusion. Though most werebears are of good alignment, some are every bit as
					evil as other lycanthropes.
				</p>
				<h4 id="wereboar">Wereboar</h4>
				<p>
					Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or
					animal form, they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its victims resist
					the curse, the more savage and bestial they become. Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of strangers
					but sometimes ally themselves with orcs.
				</p>
				<h4 id="wererat">Wererat</h4>
				<p>
					Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats
					prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape
					rather than combat. A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally
					cursed or break loose from the clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed. Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures
					are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.
				</p>
				<h4 id="wereraven">Wereraven</h4>
				<p>
					Wereravens are secretive and extraordinarily cautious lycanthropes that trust one another but are wary of just about everyone else. Although skilled at blending into society, they keep mostly to
					themselves, respect local laws, and strive to do good whenever possible. In their human and hybrid forms, wereravens favor light weapons. They are reluctant to make bite attacks in raven form for
					fear of spreading their curse to those who don't deserve it or who would abuse it. Wereravens refer to their tightly knit groups as kindnesses. A kindness of wereravens usually numbers between
					seven and twelve individuals. Not surprisingly, wereravens get along well with ravens and often hide in plain sight among them.<br>
					Wereravens like to collect shiny trinkets and precious baubles. They are fond of sharing their wealth with those in need and, in their humanoid forms, modestly give money to charity. They take
					steps to keep magic items out of evil hands by stashing them in secret hiding places.
				</p>
				<h4 id="weretiger">Weretiger</h4>
				<p>
					Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly muscular in humanoid form, they are taller than average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers
					grow to enormous size in animal and hybrid form, but they fight in their more refined humanoid form when they can. They don't like to pass on their curse, because every new weretiger means
					competition for territory and prey. Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or revel. They live and hunt alone or in small
					family groups.
				</p>
				<h4 id="werewolf">Werewolf</h4>
				<p>
					A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tenqency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form
					is more terrifying by far—a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its
					powerful claws and bite. Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family.
					Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.

					<h2>Manticore</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A monster in every sense of the word, a manticore has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. A bristling mane stretches down the creature's back, and its long
					tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range. Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large
					or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it
					uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.
				</p>
				<p>
					A manticore isn't particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they
					beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food. Manticores serve wicked
					masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant
					chief, or guard the entrance to a lamia's lair. The manticores' greatest territorial rivals include chimeras, griffins, perytons, and wyverns. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the
					advantage of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons and avoid them.

			<details id="meenlock">
				<summary>
					<h2>Meenlock</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Meenlocks are deformed fey that invoke terror and seek to destroy all that is good, innocent, and beautiful. They primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to urban and subterranean
					settings. Meenlocks are spawned by fear. Whenever fear overwhelms a creature in the Feywild, or in any other location where the Feywild's influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might
					spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it.
					One of these newly formed passageways serves as the lair's only entrance and exit. Meenlocks give other creatures the creeps and project a supernatural aura that instills terror in those nearby.
					So evil and twisted are they that a palpable sense of foreboding haunts those who intrude upon a meenlock lair. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound. A large central
					chamber serves as the meenlocks' den, where they torment captives. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Meenlocks have no form of communication other than telepathy. They can use it to project unsettling hallucinations into the minds of their prey. These hallucinations take the form of terrible
					whispers or fleeting movements just at the edges of one's peripheral vision. Meenlocks shun bright light. They can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in their vicinity and are thus
					able to teleport from one darkened space to another—enabling them to sneak up on their prey or run away when outmatched. During the day, meenlocks confine themselves to their dark warrens. At
					night, they crawl out of their tunnels to torment sleeping prey, particularly those who seem to embody all that is good in the world. Meenlocks like to paralyze creatures with their claws, drag
					them back to their hidden den, beat them unconscious, and telepathically torture them over a period of hours. A humanoid that succumbs to this psychic torment undergoes a transformation into an
					evil, full-grown meenlock.
				</p>
				<h4>Telepathic Torment</h4>
				<p>
					Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one incapacitated creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can't use their telepathy for any
					other purpose during this time, though they can move about and take actions and reactions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the frightened condition. If the
					creature is susceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. taking 3d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
					The save DC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren't incapacitated during it The
					process can be repeated. A humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM's control. Only a <i>Wish</i> spell
					or divine intervention can restore a transformed creature to its former state.

					As deadly as they are ravishing, the serpent-haired medusas suffer an immortal curse brought on by their vanity. They lurk in quiet exile among the tumbled ruins of their former lives, surrounded
					by the petrified remains of past admirers and would-be heroes.<br>
					Men and women who desire eternal youth, beauty, and adoration might pray to malicious gods, beg dragons for ancient magic, or seek out powerful archmages to fulfill their wishes. Others make
					sacrifices to demon lords or archdevils, offering all in exchange for this gift, oblivious to the curse that accompanies it. Those who strike such bargains gain physical beauty, restored youth,
					immortality, and the adoration of all who behold them, granting them the influence and power they so desire. However, after years of the living like a demigod among mortals, the price for their
					vanity and hubris is exacted, and they are forever transformed into medusas. A medusa's hair turns into a nest of venomous serpents, and all who gaze upon the medusa are petrified, becoming stone
					monuments to its corruption.<br>
					Medusas live forever in seclusion, alienated from the world around them by their monstrous form and caprice. Their homes gradually fall into disrepair until they are little more than shadowy
					ruins covered with thorns and creepers, riddled with obstructions and hiding places. Foolhardy looters and adventurers who enter are often unaware of the medusa's presence until the creature is
					among them. A medusa is subject to its own curse. By looking vainly on its reflection, it turns to stone as surely as any living mortal. As a result, a medusa destroys or removes any mirrors or

					power of its unholy curse. The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and

					treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.<br>
					An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic
					markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a
					transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.<br>
					Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of
					treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put
					to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.<br>
					A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the
					intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.<br>
					Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused
					it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed. More ephemeral or permanent
					offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures
					responsible and still not sate its wrath.<br>
					Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful
					individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.

				<h4 id="mummylord">Mummy Lord</h4>
				<p>
					In the tombs of the ancients, tyrannical monarchs and the high priests of dark gods lie in dreamless rest, waiting for the time when they might reclaim their thrones and reforge their ancient
					empires. The regalia of their terrible rule still adorns their linen-wrapped bodies, their moldering robes stitched with evil symbols and bronze armor etched with devices of dynasties that fell a
					thousand years before.<br>
					Under the direction of the most powerful priests, the ritual that creates a mummy can be increased in potency. The mummy lord that rises from such a ritual retains the memories and personality of
					its former life, and is gifted with supernatural resilience. Dead emperors wield the same infamous rune-marked blades that they did in legend. Sorcerer lords work the forbidden magic that once
					controlled a terrified populace, and the dark gods reward dead priest-kings' prayers by imparting divine spells.<br>
					As part of the ritual that creates a mummy lord, the creature's heart and viscera are removed from the corpse and placed in canopic jars. These jars are usually carved from limestone or made of
					pottery, etched or painted with religious hieroglyphs. As long as its shriveled heart remains intact, a mummy lord can't be permanently destroyed. For this reason, a mummy lord usually keeps its
					heart and viscera in a hidden tomb or vault.
				</p>
				<p>
					A mummy lord watches over an ancient temple or tomb that is protected by lesser undead and rigged with traps. Hidden in this temple is the sarcophagus where a mummy lord keeps its
					greatest treasures. A mummy lord's lair is warped in any of the following ways by the creature's dark presence:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other non magical drinks are spoiled—wine turning to vinegar, for instance.</li>
					<li>Divination spells cast within the lair by creatures other than the mummy lord have a 25 percent chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a divination spell
						already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.</li>
					<li>A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a
						<i>Remove Curse</i> spell or other magic.</li>

					Archmages are rare, special people. Lots of bosses and important characters throughout the different adventure modules use variants of the archmage for villains, rulers, and all manner of other
					important people. If you're planning to introduce an archmage into your campaign, they deserve every bit of development you give to people like kings. In addition to their prepared spells, they

				<p>
					Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life
					of banditry.<br>
					It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The <b>Bandit Captain</b> has these qualities in spades.<br>
					Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's
					vessels.<br>
					In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must
					mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.<br>
					More than treasure, a bandit or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not
					to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
				</p>
				<h4 id="bard">Bard</h4>
				<p>
					Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide, but are commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries,
					and wealthy patrons.
				</p>
				<h4 id="berserker">Berserker</h4>
				<p>
					Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable berserkers come together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.
				</p>
				<h4 id="champion">Champion</h4>
				<p>
					Champions are mighty warriors who honed their fighting skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their
					presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.
				</p>
				<h4 id="commoner">Commoner</h4>
				<p>
					Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.
				</p>
				<h4 id="cultist">Cultist</h4>
				<p>
					Cultists swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental princes, demon lords, or archdevils. Most conceal their loyalties to avoid being ostracized, imprisoned, or executed for their beliefs.
					Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.<br>
					Fanatics are often part of a cult's leadership, using their charisma and dogma to influence and prey on those of weak will. Most are interested in personal power above all else.
				</p>
				<h4 id="diviner">Diviner</h4>
				<p>
					Diviners are specialist wizards who know that knowl￾edge is power. They might act aloof and mysterious, hinting at omens and secrets, or they might be know-it￾alls, spilling secrets and insights
					to advance their own status or reputation.
				</p>
				<h4 id="druid">Druid</h4>
				<p>
					Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the
					sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.
				</p>
				<h4 id="elitesoldier">Elite Soldier</h4>
				<p>
					Elite Soldiers are extremely well-trained, and are usually members of a personal guard or a special army corp. Real-life analogues are things like the persian Immortals, the Swiss Guard, or the
					Caroleans.
				</p>
				<h4 id="gladiator">Gladiator</h4>
				<p>
					Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who
					command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
				</p>
				<h4 id="guard">Guard</h4>
				<p>
					Guards include members of a city watch, sentries in a citadel or fortified town, and the bodyguards of merchants and nobles.
				</p>
				<h4 id="knight">Knight</h4>
				<p>
					Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or
					patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.
				</p>
				<h4 id="krakenpriest">Kraken Priest</h4>
				<p>
					A kraken can seem godlike to folk who have witnessed its fury. Those who mistake its might for divine power and those who seek to appease the monster through veneration are sometimes rewarded
					with power, to serve thereafter as kraken priests. The kraken can make itself dimly aware of a kraken priest's thoughts if the two are on the same plane of existence, and it can then push aside
					the priest's personality and control it. Kraken priests can thereby act as eyes and ears for their masters, and when the kraken has something to say, the priest becomes its mouthpiece.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every kraken priest undergoes a change in appearance that reflects the kraken's influence, although each one differs in how its reverence is displayed. One kraken priest might have ink-black eyes
					and a suckered tentacle for a tongue, while another has a featureless face and a body covered in eyes and mouths that dribble seawater. These horrific manifestations intensify when the kraken
					possesses its minion to utter its dire pronouncements.
				</p>
				<h4 id="magenpc">Mage</h4>
				<p>
					Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable
					experiments without interference.
				</p>
				<h4 id="martialartsadept">Martial Arts Adept</h4>
				<p>
					Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master.
					A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.
				</p>
				<h4 id="masterthief">Master Thief</h4>
				<p>
					Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a reputation and a cult of personality. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild,
					spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.
				</p>
				<h4 id="necromancer">Necromancer</h4>
				<p>
					Necromancers are specialist wizards who study the interaction of life, death, and undeath. Some like to dig up corpses to create undead slaves. A few use their powers for good, becoming hunters
					of the undead and risking their lives to save others.
				</p>
				<h4 id="noble">Noble</h4>
				<p>
					Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the
					company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners. The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.
				</p>
				<h4 id="priest">Priest</h4>
				<p>
					Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might
					work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help
					with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.
				</p>
				<h4 id="spy">Scout</h4>
				<p>
					Scouts are skilled hunters and trackers who offer their services for a fee. Most hunt wild game, but a few work as bounty hunters, serve as guides, or provide military reconnaissance.
				</p>
				<h4 id="spy">Spy</h4>
				<p>
					Rulers, nobles, merchants, guild masters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal
					spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.
				</p>
				<h4 id="swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</h4>
				<p>
					Swashbucklers are charming ne'er-do-wells who live by their own codes of honor. They crave notoreity, often indulge in romantic trysts, and eke out livings as pirates and corsairs, rarely staying
					in one place for too long.
				</p>
				<h4 id="thug">Thug</h4>
				<p>
					Thugs are ruthless enforcers skilled at intimidation and violence. They work for money and have few scruples.
				</p>
				<h4 id="tribalwarrior">Tribal Warrior</h4>

					Tribal warriors live beyond civilization, most often subsisting on fishing and hunting. Each tribe acts in accordance with the wishes of its chief, who is the greatest or oldest warrior of the
					tribe or a tribe member blessed by the gods.
				</p>
				<h4 id="veteran">Veteran</h4>
				<p>
					Veterans are professional fighters that take up arms for pay or to protect something they believe in or value. Their ranks include soldiers retired from long service and warriors who never served
					anyone but themselves.
				</p>
				<h4 id="warpriest">War Priest</h4>
				<p>
					War priests worship deities of war and combat. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as a
					warlord's right hand on the battlefield.
				</p>
				<h4 id="warlockofthearchfey">Warlock of the Archfey</h4>
				<p>
					Warlocks of the archfey gain their powers through magical pacts forged with lords of the Feywild. These warlocks commonly associate with lesser fey creatures such as boggles, quicklings, redcaps,
					satyrs, and sprites.
				</p>
				<h4 id="warlord">Warlord</h4>
				<p>
					Warlords are legendary battlefield commanders whose names are spoken with awt. After a string of decisive victories, a warlord could easily take on the role of monarch or general and attract
					followers willing to die for his or her banner.
				</p>

			<details id="nymphs">
				<summary>
					<h2>Nymphs</h2>
				</summary>
				Divine servants that inhabit unspoiled corners of the world, nymphs protect places of natural power and infuse their surroundings with the magic of nature. Some are benevolent and aid those who live
				off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild
				animals, or other cosmic forces. Occasionally, though, groups of the same kind of nymphs congregate in a place of natural power or beauty. In times of special need, deities tied to facets of
				nature might employ nymphs as messengers, guardians, or scouts.
				<h4 id="alseid">Alseid</h4>
				<p>
					Touched with the golden light of the sun, alseids inhabit meadows, plains, and lands of cultivated natural beauty. Many live in closer proximity to human civilization than other nymphs. Farmers
					are grateful for the presence of alseids on their lands and often leave them offerings of mead, honey, flowers, and dates in return for protecting their flocks and making their crops more
					abundant.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dryad">Dryad</h4>
				<p>
					Travelers entering a forest might catch a glimpse of a feminine form flitting through the trees. Warm laughter hangs on the air, drawing those who hear it deeper into the emerald shadows.
					Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love
					is forbidden. A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world. As long as the tree remains healthy and unharmed, the
					dryad stays forever youthful and alluring. If the tree is harmed, she suffers. If the tree is ever destroyed, the dryad descends into madness.<br>
					Dryads act as guardians of their woodland demesnes. Shy and reclusive, they watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty of a stranger might investigate more closely, perhaps
					even try to lure the individual away to be charmed. Dryads work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to druids that
					share the dryads' devotion to the woods they call home.<br>
					Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile humanoids with her enchantments,
					turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.
				</p>
				<h4 id="lampad">Lampad</h4>
				<p>
					Lampads are psychopomps on certain worlds, leading the souls of the dead from the remains of their mortal coils to the afterlife and/or ultimate judgement. Lampads are closely affiliated with
					gods of the grave domain, and are most often spotted in graveyards, crumbling crypts, and tunnels that bore deep into the earth. A lampad found in a place that seems notably bereft of death might
					be out to reclaim wayward souls, seeking to return those who have wandered from their graves or escaped from the realm of the dead.
				</p>
				<h4 id="naiad">Naiad</h4>
				<p>
					Naiads live in and near water. They might be spotted among rivers and lakes, on isolated shores, or amid coral labyrinths and deep sea fumaroles. Wherever rivers and seas show their variety and
					force, naiads gather to revel in nature's might. Individual naiads often grow fixated with a single type or body of water, potentially preferring a deep sea trench, coastline, or river system 
					above all others. Over time, such a resident nymph often becomes connected with her aquatic home through sightings and stories, becoming a guardian of the place and, in effect, a manifestation
					of its personality.<br>
					Curious by nature, naiads often seek out what the seas and rivers claim. As a result, they might be found among sunken ruins and shipwrecks, sifting through the remains for whatever catches
					their eye. Living creatures aren't exempt from this curiosity, either. Naiads are known to befriend aquatic creatures, or even to keep modest menageries. The occasional star-crossed castaway has
					even been known to become part of such collections.<br>
					Sailors across the world claim that naiads know all the secret aquatic routes of travel. Using this hidden system of currents and arter￾ies, a ship might reach any destination in record time, be
					it across the sea or along a river a hundred miles inland. Naiads do nothing to dissuade sailors from this belief, and certainly numerous reports tell of charmed nymphs leading lost seafarers
					home. Yet, if tales of naiad-led galleys appearing amid the headwaters of mountain rivers are true, only the nymphs know for sure. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="oread">Oread</h4>
				<p>
					Aggressive oreads number among the most dangerous nymphs, as they embody the wild might of flames, volcanism, and the hidden forces of the earth. These creatures typically dwell in remote
					mountain crags and near volcanoes, where they caper among the forces of dissolution and rebirth. During avalanches and volcanic eruptions, groups of oreads might race ahead of the destruction,
					dancing, singing, and doing what they can to maximize the impending devastation.<br>
					Hearkening back to some ages-old conflict, oreads refuse to knowingly destroy any land inhabited by another nymph. While they won't work to alter the natural course of destruction, neither will
					they make another nymph's home part of any calamity they encourage. As a result, part of what makes an alseid's field or a dryad's grove seem so blessed is that oreads go out of their way to
					leave such sites alone.
					The followers of gods of the forge regard oreads with special reverence, as myths tell of cagey smiths befriending these nymphs and convincing them to aid in creating phenomenal works. In some
					tales, a smith finds an oread and allows it to relish in the destruction of a novel or remarkable item. In recompense, the oread pro￾vides the smith with materials drawn from the burning heart
					of the world, allowing the smith to create an even greater wonder. In more tales, though, a smith pursues an oread, then later the mortal's associates find familiar tools and a heap of ashes.

			<details><!--Oozes-->
				<summary>
					<h2>Oozes</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along
					the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is
					often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran
					explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.
				</p>
				<p>
					An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades
					can come to the rescue before it is too late. Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A
					slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers. Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure
					it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors
					feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few
					beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and
					eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.
				</p>
				<h4 id="blackpudding">Black Pudding</h4>
				<p>
					A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow. Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the
					pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dragonbloodooze">Dragonblood Ooze</h4>
				<p>
					Magic-minded artisans have long incorporated parts of dragons' bodies into magic items, crafting dragon hide into armor and forging weapons from claws and teeth. Alchemists have found beneficial
					uses for dragon blood, but ill-advised experiments have also given rise to dragonblood oozes. The congealed blood of a dragon given mobility and hunger, the ooze tries to shape itself into a
					draconic form. It cannot hold a coherent shape for long and soon collapses into an amorphous heap. Similarly, it tries to manifest a breath weapon but manages only to spew forth part of its own
					body that it then reels back in.
				</p>
				<h4 id="grayooze">Gray Ooze</h4>
				<p>
					A gray ooze is stone turned to liquid by chaos. When it moves, it slithers like a liquid snake, fising to strike. A gray ooze that lives a long time can evolve to become more intelligent and
					develop limited psionic ability. Such occurrences are more common in gray oozes that live near psionic creatures such as mind flayers, suggesting that the ooze can sense and mimic psionic
					ability.
				</p>
				<h4 id="oblex">Oblex</h4>
				<p>
					By experimenting on the slimes, jellies, and puddings that infest the depths of the Underdark, mind flayers created a special breed of ooze, the oblex—a slime capable of assaulting the minds of
					other creatures. Cunning hunters, these pools of jelly stalk prey, searching for the memories they so desperately crave. When oblexes feed on those thoughts, sometimes killing their victims, they
					can form weird copies of their prey, which help them to harvest even more victims for their dark masters. Oblexes feed on thoughts and memories. The sharper the mind, the better the meal, so
					oblexes hunt obviously intelligent targets such as wizards and other spellcasters. When suitable fare comes within reach, an oblex draws its body up to engulf its victim. As it withdraws, it
					plunders the creature's mind, leaving its prey befuddled and confused
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Oblex Spawn:</b><br>
					An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its existence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature's personality—now twisted by
					the oblex's foul nature. The more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else go insane. This act spawns a new oblex. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Adult and Elder Oblexes:</b><br>
					Newly formed oblexes lack the capabilities of their older kin. They seek only to feed on memories and grow until they can impersonate their victims. Older oblexes, called adults and elders, have
					eaten so many memories that they can form duplicates of the creatures they have devoured from the substance of their bodies, sending them off to lure prey into their clutches, while remaining
					tethered to the slime by long tendrils of goo. These duplicated creatures are indistinguishable from their victims except for a faint sulfurous smell. Oblexes use these duplicates to lure prey
					into danger or to infiltrate settlements so they can feed on superior victims.
				</p>
				<h4 id="ochrejelly">Ochre Jelly</h4>
				<p>
					Ochre jellies are yellowish blobs that can slide under doors and through narrow cracks in pursuit of creatures to devour. They have enough bestial cunning to avoid large groups of enemies. An
					ochre jelly follows at a safe distance as it pursues its meal. Its digestive enzymes dissolve flesh quickly but have no effect on other substances such as bone, wood, and metal. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="slitheringtracker">Slithering Tracker</h4>
				<p>
					The quest for revenge sometimes leads one to undergo a ritual whereby they transform into a body of semiliquid sentience known as a slithering tracker. Innocuous and insidious at the same time, a
					tracker flows into places where a normal creature can't go and brings its own brand of watery death down upon its quarry. The ritual for creating a slithering tracker is known to hags, liches,
					and priests who worship gods of vengeance. It can only be performed on a willing creature that hungers for revenge. The ritual sucks all the moisture from the person's body, killing it. Yet the
					mind lives on in the puddle of liquid that issues forth from the remains, and so too does the subject's insatiable need for retribution
				</p>
				<p>
					A slithering tracker tastes the ground it courses over, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slithering tracker rises up and enshrouds a creature, attempting to drown the prey while also
					draining it of blood. A slithering tracker that has killed in this fashion becomes much easier to locate for a time, since its liquid form becomes tinged with blood and its body leaves a visible
					trail of the stuff behind it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end a slithering tracker's existence, nor its hunger for blood. Some slithering trackers remain aware of their purpose and extend their quest for
					vengeance to others, such as anyone who supported or befriended the original target. Most of the time, though, a tracker's mind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form, unable to
					communicate, and driven by the desire for blood: after a tracker fulfills its duty, insanity takes over the creature, and it attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.
				</p>

			<details id="oni">
				<summary>
					<h2>Oni</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					In nursery rhymes, oni are fearsome bogeymen that haunt the nightmares of children and adults alike, yet they are very real and always hungry. They find human babies especially delicious. Oni
					look like demonic ogres with blue or green skin, dark hair, and a pair of short ivory horns protruding from their foreheads. Their eyes are dark with strikingly white pupils, and their teeth and
					claws are jet black. 
				</p>
				<p>
					By the light of day, an oni hides its true form with magic, gaining the trust of those it intends to betray when darkness descends. These creatures can change their size as well as their shape,
					appearing as humanoids as they pass through towns, pretending to be travelers, woodcutters, or frontier folk. In such a form, an oni takes stock of the selection of humanoids in a settlement and
					devises ways to abduct and devour some of them. Oni are sometimes called ogre mages because of their innate magical ability. Though they are only distantly related to true ogres, they share the
					ogres' habit of joining forces with other evil creatures. An oni serves a master if doing so proves lucrative or provides it with a luxurious, well-defended home. Oni covet magic, and they work
					for evil wizards and hags in exchange for useful magic items.

			<details id="otyugh">
				<summary>
					<h2>Otyugh</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					An otyugh is a grotesque, bulbous creature borne along on three sturdy legs, its eyes and nose set along a vinelike stalk that snakes from the top of its bloated body. Two rubbery tentacles end
					in spiky, leaf-like appendages that the otyugh uses to shovel food into its gaping maw. An otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed. When an
					edible creature happens by, the otyugh's tentacles erupt from the filth and grab hold of it. Otyughs make the most of any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of
					telepathy to urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending to be something else. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Otyughs tolerate bright light only when considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilderness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dells. The
					scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled animal pens attracts them to civilized areas. Since otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes
					accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk. Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful
					sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as it is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking
					other creatures. However, would-be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, and meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food. More than one
					"trained" otyugh has eaten its keeper after devouring all the waste in its wallow.

			<details id="owlbear">
				<summary>
					<h2>Owlbear</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and
					the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head. The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most
					feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature
					cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.
				</p>
				<p>
					An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its
					hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes. An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of
					its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near
					an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey. Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is
					required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a
					master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will
					attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first. Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during
					the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owl bears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly
					eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves
					claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.

				<summary>
					<h2>Pixie</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Standing barely a foot tall, pixies resemble diminutive elves with gossamer wings like those of dragonflies or butterflies, bright as the clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise. Curious
					as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce themselves and strike up a
					friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Unlike their fey cousins, the sprites, pixies abhor weapons and would sooner flee than get
					into a physical altercation with any enemy.<br>
					Those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh. Pixies array themselves like princes and princesses of the fey, wearing
					flowing gowns and doublets of silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond. Some dress in acorns, leaves, bark, and the pelts of tiny woodland beasts. They take great pride in their regalia and
					beam with joy when they are complimented on their ensembles.<br>
					With their innate power of invisibility, pixies rarely appear unless they wish to be seen. In the Feywild and on the Material Plane, pixies etch patterns of frost on winter ponds and rouse the
					buds in springtime. They cause flowers to sparkle with summer dew, and color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn.<br>
					While the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge their temperament or play harmless tricks on
					them to measure their reactions. For example, pixies might tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead interlopers astray. If
					the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and more friendly. The fey might even emerge and
					offer to guide their "guests" along a safe route or invite them to a tiny yet satisfying feast prepared in their honor.<br>
					<b>Pixie Dust:</b> When pixies fly visibly, a shower of sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star. A mere sprinkle of pixie dust is said to be able to grant
					the power of flight, confuse a creature hopelessly, or send foes into a magical slumber. Only pixies can use their dust to its full potential, but these fey are constantly sought out by mages and
					monsters seeking to study or master their power.

					<h2>Pseudodragon</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The elusive pseudodragon dwells in the quiet places of the world, making its home in the hollows of trees and small caves. With its red-brown scales, horns, and a maw filled with sharp teeth,
					a pseudodragon resembles a tiny red dragon but its disposition is playful.<br>
					Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail,
					one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours.<br>
					Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing
					companions, but they can sometimes be won over with gifts of food or treasure. When a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly. 
					A pseudodragon puts up with no ill treatment, and it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion without warning.<br>
					Pseudodragons can't speak, but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, a
					pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and hears even over long distances. A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant
					surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.

					<h2>Purple Worm</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The massive burrowing monster known as the purple worm terrorizes the creatures of the Underdark as it chews through solid rock in pursuit of prey. A dimwitted, ravenous force of nature, this
					creature regards anything it encounters as food. Loud noise attracts purple worms, which have been known to interrupt underground battles and tear through subterranean cities seeking prey. The
					underground civilizations of the drow, the duergar, and the mind flayers maintain special wards around their settlements to deter these monsters. Though most common in the Underdark, purple worms
					are frequently seen on the surface world in rocky and mountainous lands. The maw of a purple worm is large enough to swallow a horse whole, and no creature is safe from its hunger. It lunges
					forward by rhythmically compressing and expanding its body, catching other Underdark dwellers by surprise with the speed of its advance.
				</p>
				<p>
					A <b>purple wormling</b> is a baby purple worm no more than six weeks old. Its rubbery body is 9 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds. Its mouth and musculature aren't yet strong enough to allow the
					wormling to burrow through rock. The poison in its tail stinger and the acid in its gullet are still relatively weak as well. Nevertheless, the wormling is a voracious feeder and attacks just
					about anything it can wrap its mouth around.
				</p>
				<h4>Boons of the Worm</h4>
				<p>
					When a purple worm burrows through the ground, it consumes earth and rock, which it breaks down and constantly excretes. Precious metals and gems can thus be found within the bodies of purple
					worms, which are targeted by particularly brave and foolhardy treasure hunters. A burrowing purple worm constantly creates new tunnels throughout the Underdark, which are quickly made use of by
					other creatures as corridors and highways. Because a purple worm rarely returns to its own tunnels, such passageways are a good place to avoid these monsters. Areas rich in prey quickly become
					interlaced with complex tunnel systems resulting from several worms hunting together.

					<h2>Quaggoth</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Savage and territorial, quaggoths climb the chasms of the Underdark. They maul their foes in a frenzy, becoming even more murderous in the face of death. Quaggoths were never an enlightened
					species, but they were not always the brutal Underdark denizens they are today. In a distant age, quaggoth tribes dwelled upon the surface as nocturnal arboreal hunters, possessing their own
					language and culture. When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark did the
					quaggoths survive.<br>
					As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird magic of their new realm
					transformed them. Turning increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food they could find—and when they could not find it, they preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of their
					culture, their past was abandoned. Generations of hunting venomous subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced quaggoths to adapt
					immunities to poisons of all kinds.<br>
					The ancient enmity between quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging their
					ferocity while strengthening their obedience. Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on
					surface raids against known elven enclaves.<br>
					<b>Thonots:</b> Some quaggoths absorb psionic energy that suffuses certain parts of the Underdark. When a tribe discovers that one of its own has inherited such powers, they press it into the
					role of tribal shaman, or thonot. A thonot keep a tribe's lore and ensures its superiority against enemies. A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual, in the
					hope that its power passes to another more worthy quaggoth.

				<p>
					A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its
					mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original
					body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes
					the revenant for what it truly is.
				</p>
				<p>
					A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the
					afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest. No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always
					knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting
					with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each revenant is a unique individual and can have traits reflecting that. Revenants that were spellcasters before they died might retain some or all of their spellcasting capabilities. Similarly,
					revenants that wore armor and wielded weapons in life might continue to do so.

					At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads sixty meters
					or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the ancient days when giants battled dragons for control of the world, Annam, the father of the giant gods, created the rocs so that his worshipers might challenge the dragons' dominance of
					the air. When the war ended, the rocs were freed from giant domination and spread throughout the world. Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even
					giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it
					ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its
					massive talons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Roes are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in
					mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures. Sometimes a roc's nest contains treasures from the caravans or ships they raid, but these creatures are heedless of such baubles. More
					rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.

					Salamanders slither across the Sea of Ash on the Elemental Plane of Fire, their sinuous coils and jagged spines smoldering. Intense heat washes off their bodies, while their yellow eyes glow
					like candles in the deep-set hollows of their hawkish faces. Salamanders adore power, and they delight in setting fire to things. Outside their home plane, they play among the burning skeletons
					of charred trees as forest fires rage around them, or slither down the slopes of erupting volcanoes to linger in fire pits and magma floes.<br>
					Salamanders hatch from eggs that are two-foot-diameter spheres of smoldering obsidian. When a salamander is ready to hatch, it melts its way through the egg's thick shell and emerges as a fire 
					snake. A fire snake matures into a salamander adult within a year.<br>
					Long ago, the efreet hired azers to build the fabled City of Brass, but then failed in their attempt to enslave that mystical race when the azers' work was done. Turning instead to strike against
					the salamanders, the efreet had better luck in establishing a slave race, which they use to unleash war and destruction across the planes.<br>
					Salamanders despise the azers, believing that if the efreet had succeeded in dominating that race of elemental crafters, the salamanders would still be free. The efreet use this enmity to their
					own advantage, stoking the salamanders' hatred and pitting them against the efreets' former servants. The efreet suffer salamanders to serve no other master; when efreet encounter salamanders
					dedicated to the cults of Elemental Evil, they slay them rather than taking them as slaves.<br>
					Although salamanders follow the destructive impulses of their fiery nature, slavery under the efreet has impacted the culture of free salamanders. They rule their own societies according to the
					efreet model, in which larger and stronger salamanders claim dominion over their lesser kin. As salamanders age, they increase in size and status, rising to positions of power as cruel nobles
					among their kind. Nobles rule wandering bands of salamanders, which move across the Elemental Plane of Fire like desert nomads, raiding other communities for treasure.<br>
					Salamanders generate intense heat, and when they fight, their weapons glow red and sear the bodies of their enemies on contact. Even approaching a salamander is dangerous, since flesh blisters
					and burns in its proximity. This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and steel with their bare hands. Although not as meticulous as
					azers, salamanders number among the greatest metalsmiths in all the planes. Powerful creatures summon them as warriors, but others enlist the salamanders for their crafting skills, or bind them
					to forges and ovens to generate limitless heat.

					live on as sea spawn, haunting the waves like tortured reflections of their former selves. Coral encrusts them. Barnacles cling to their cold skin. Lungs that once filled with air can now breathe
					in water as well. Tales provide myriad reasons for these strange transformations. "Be wary of falling in love with a sea elf or a merfolk," some say. "Return to port before a storm, no matter how
					tempting the catch." "Honor the sea gods as they demand, but never promise them your heart." Such cautionary tales disguise the deeper truth: things lurk beneath the waves that strive to claim

					Sea spawn come in a wide variety of forms. An individual might have a tentacle for an arm, the jaws of a shark, a sea urchin's spines, a whale's fin, octopus eyes, seaweed hair, or any

				<p>
					Sea serpents rank alongside dragon turtles as some of the most feared predators of the deep and inspire many sailors' worst nightmares. Their strong fins propel them through the water at great
					speed. Young sea serpents are agile hunters. They use reefs and natural camouflage to hide before they strike, picking off members of a ship's crew one by one. Ancient sea serpents grow large
					enough to demolish whole ships, then feed at leisure on helpless sailors in the water. At any age, a sea serpent attacks with terrible bites, a lashing tail, a constricting grip, and a frigid
					breath weapon that can leave sailors' corpses floating frozen amid the wreckage of their ships.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sea serpents are as fiercely territorial as any other dragons, and they do not take kindly to ships passing over their domains without permission. Some can be appeased by offerings of treasure,
					but most demand that a ship's crew sacrifice one or more of their own. Living amid the wreckage of sunken ships or in deep sea caves, sea serpents collect the cargo of the craft they sink,
					amassing great hoards of trade goods, sailors' trinkets, and pirates' booty.

					<h2>Shambling Mound</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A shambling mound, sometimes called a shambler, trudges ponderously through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests, consuming any organic matter in its path. This rotting heap of animated
					vegetation looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless "head" at its top. A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an
					otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots
					eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food. A shambling mound tirelessly consumes plants as it moves and devours animals that
					can't escape it. Only the shambling mounds' rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of plant and animal
					life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch
					creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a
					shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the rotting heap that it simultaneously
					accumulates and feeds on, which protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from any creature. The dense mass of a shambling mound's body shrugs off the effects of cold and
					fire. Lightning reinvigorates the root-stem, strengthening the shambling mound and bolstering its consumptive drive. Despite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant that
					requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn't sleep the way an animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt for food. If a shambling mound faces defeat before an
					overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death, collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the root-stem beds down in the shambler's remains to slowly regrow its full body,
					then once again sets out to consume all it can. In this way, shambling mound infestations long thought destroyed can recur time and again.

					<h2>Skeleton</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated
					with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br>
					Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in
					a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and
					soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it. While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of
					other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br>
					Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of
					their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake
					their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br>
					A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful
					instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished. Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its
					way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br>
					Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living
					selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie
					down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance. When skeletons
					encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight
					until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.

					A skulk can be summoned from the Shadowfell by performing a ritual. If the creature is given a portion of the summoner's identity, the skulk is bound to obey the summoner's commands for 30 days.
					If a skulk is visible, an astute observer might deduce who summoned it, because a skulk assumes a vague likeness of its master. Cruel and chaotic, skulks carry out their orders in the most
					violent manner possible. A summoned skulk can't return to the Shadowfell until it dies, so it has every motivation to throw itself into creating bloodshed and mayhem. After killing a person in
					the material world, a skulk sometimes takes up a silent imitation of that person's life. In extreme cases, skulks have invaded villages, killed all the occupants, and turned the places into

					In sacred isolation, a sphinx guards the secrets and treasures of the gods. As it calmly regards each new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest seekers that failed to
					pass its tests lie scattered around its lair. Its great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in
					half. Sphinxes test the worth of those who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten secrets or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. Creatures that choose to face a sphinx's
					test are bound to that test unto death, and only those worthy will survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys.<br>
					Some sphinxes are high priests of the gods that create them, but most are simply embodied spirits, brought into the mortal realm by devout prayer or direct intervention. A sphinx maintains its
					vigil tirelessly, not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind, knowing no other life except its sacred mission. The secrets and treasures a sphinx guards remain under
					divine protection, so that when a creature fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will still fail to
					gain the secret it sought—and will make an enemy of the god that placed the sphinx as a guardian. Benign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove supplicants that fail their tests,
					transporting them away and ensuring that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.<br>
					Mortals that encounter sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins between tumbled stone walls
					might suddenly shift to an alien locale, such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an
					extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.<br>
					Whether through the weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, some sphinxes break free of
					their divine command. However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deems worthy.<br>
					On certain worlds, such as the planes of Vryn and Ravnica, sphinxes play a part in mortal society not as keepers of secrets, but as judges and lawmakers. Such sphinxes may have different spells
					prepared, particularly if they take part in enforcing the law on the ground.

					androsphinx tests the courage and valor of supplicants, not only by forcing them to complete quests but also with its terrible roar, which echoes for miles as it terrifies and deafens nearby
					creatures. Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a <a href="../pg/spells.html?l=HeroesFeast"><i>Heroes' Feast</i></a>.

					difficult trial awaits them. Gynosphinxes are virtual libraries of knowledge and lore. They ask riddles and present puzzles to test the wit of supplicants that come to learn their secrets. Some
					are willing to bargain with such supplicants for treasure or service.

					taking severe measures to ward strangers away from their homes. Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.<br>
					Sprites build little villages in the boughs of trees and willing treants, in verdant glades brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools. Wild nature thrives, and the sprites allow no
					trespassers. When intruders are spotted, the sprites lead them astray with ominous rustling from the bushes and distant snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in intruding on a

					forest.<br>
					Sprites can sense whether a creature is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart. Weighing the balance of a creature's past actions, a sprite can tell whether its heart beats
					rapidl in love or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or greed. The sprite's power to perceive the heart always shows the truth, because the heart can't lie.<br>
					In their forest domains, sprites brew toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons, including the sleep poison with which they coat their arrows. They venture far into the woods to harvest rare
					flowers, mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous territory to do so. If desperate, sprites even steal their ingredients from the gardens of hags.<br>
					Because they are judges of the heart and favor good creatures, s prites oppose the will of evil fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn. If they encounter adventurers on a quest to
					rid their forest of an evil fey creature or goblinoid menace, they will pledge their support and even come to their aid when the adventurers least expect it. Unlike pixies, sprites rarely indulge
					in frivolous merriment and fun. They are firm warriors, protectors, and judges, and their stern bent causes other fey to consider them overly dour and serious. However, fey that respect the

					horrifying nature of their deaths, those slain by strigoi occasionally reanimate as boneless. Many strigoi seek ways to return to their former existence while being compelled to drain living
					victims. Others, though, embrace their new forms and mimic vampires. These would-be bloodsucker aristocrats create stirge courts amid scabrous husk-decorated villas and drain the life from any
					who balk at their grotesque gentility.

					<h2>Stone Cursed</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The stone cursed are spawned through a foul alchemical ritual performed on a humanoid that has been turned to stone. The ritual, which requires a mixture of basilisk blood and the ashes from the
					burned feathers of a cockatrice, awakens a dim echo of the petrified victim's spirit, animating the statue and turning it into a useful guardian. The stone cursed possess a malevolent drive to
					slay the living, yet they are utterly loyal to whoever performed the ritual to animate them, and they obey that being's orders to the best of their ability. In combat, stony claws that drip with
					thick, gray sludge emerge from a stone cursed's fingers. This alchemical sludge transforms those slashed by the claws into statues.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of the ritual used to create a stone cursed, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the creature's torso. The skull isn't visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain,
					the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a dim echo of the original victim's memories resonates within the
					skull. A skilled magic-wielder can attempt to extract memories from it to gain insight into the victim's past or find lore that otherwise would be lost. At the end of a short rest, a character
					can make a DC20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to attempt to extract a memory from the skull—a memory that is a response to a verbal question posed by the character to the skull. Once this check is
					made, whether it succeeds or fails, the skull can't be used in this manner again.

				<summary><h2>The Tarrasque</h2></summary>
				<p>
					The legendary tarrasque is possibly the most dreaded monster of the Material Plane. It is widely believed that only one of these creatures exists, though no one can predict where and when it
					will strike. A scaly biped, the tarrasque is fifty feet tall and seventy feet long, weighing hundreds of tons. It carries itself like a theropod dinosaur, leaning forward and using its powerful
					lashing tail for balance. Its cavernous maw yawns wide enough to swallow all but the largest creatures, and so great is its hunger that it can devour the populations of whole towns. The
					destructive potential of the tarrasque is so vast that some cultures incorporate the monster into religious doctrine, weaving its sporadic appearance into stories of divine judgment and wrath. 
					Legends tell how the tarrasque slumbers in its secret lair beneath the earth, remaining in a dormant state for decades or centuries. When it awakens in answer to some inscrutable cosmic call, it
					rises from the depths to obliterate everything in its path.

			<details id="treant">
				<summary>
					<h2>Treant</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Treants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests. Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes
					from outside threats. A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do
					so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret
					groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long
					branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.<br>
					After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over
					plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.<br>
					Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place
					miles away based on subtle changes nearby. Woodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire.
					Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant's wrath.

			<details><!--Trolls-->
				<summary>
					<h2>Trolls</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Born with horrific appetites, trolls eat anything they can catch and devour. They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As
					payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Smashing a troll's bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll's wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts
					can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a
					troll's flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey. Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to
					mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a
					troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature's traits. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre mutations. One of these warped trolls is especially likely to arise if the creature
					regenerates in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if its body was damaged by elemental forces. These mutated forms can also be produced and
					shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Vaprak the Destroyer</b><br>
					Although trolls are hardly devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, they do fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. As with many lesser deities, Vaprak's true nature is
					something of a mystery, but it is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. It's given to fits of mindless destruction and is constantly paranoid
					about the plots and ambitions of other deities. Among trolls, Vaprak is believed to devour those on the brink of death, but only if the troll is already cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid).
					Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body, no matter how little of its previous form remained. Thus, only trolls slain by acid or fire remain dead, because
					only those are consumed by Vaprak. 
				</p>
				<h2>Troll Varieties</h2>
				<h4 id="diretroll">Dire Troll</h4>
				<p>
					Trolls kill and eat almost anything—including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing the troll to grow to an unusually large size. These dire trolls crave more
					and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth. Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh and organs onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a
					fresh wound on the dire troll, its regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into its own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and other organs that a dire
					troll tears from its victims and grafts onto itself. Over time, these creatures can accumulate many limbs.
				</p>
				<h4 id="icetroll">Ice Troll</h4>
				<p>
					Ice trolls have all the meanness and hunger of common trolls. Their hearts radiate extreme cold, to the detriment of other nearby creatures. An ice troll's heart remains cold even after the
					troll's destruction. As long as the troll can't regenerate, its heart can be safely removed from its remains, handled, and kept. An ice troll's heart, once removed, becomes a harmless Tiny object
					with AC13, 4 hit points, and immunity to all damage except fire damage. For the next 24 hours, the heart has the following magical properties:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A creature that eats the heart gains the ability to regenerate for the next 24 hours, regaining 5 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this
						trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.</li>
					<li>lf buried in the ground under a foot or more of earth, the heart melts away and summons a blizzard like that created by the <i>Control Weather</i> spell. It takes 10 minutes for the heart to
						melt and the blizzard to form. The blizzard lasts for 8 hours.</li>
					<li>A hag or similar creature can perform a ritual that turns the heart into a magical talisman that acts like a patch of brown mold (see the Dungeon Master's Guide). This effect lasts until the
						heart is destroyed.</li>
					<li>A creature proficient with alchemist's supplies can squeeze enough residual fluid out of the heart to mix with other alchemical ingredients, creating one <i class="uncmmagit">Potion of Cold
						Resistance</i>. It takes 1 hour to create this potion.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 id="rottroll">Rot Troll</h4>
				<p>
					A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll's body withers, and its flesh falls away from the
					body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy that flows out of its withered form.
					Simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to its lethal emanations.
				</p>
				<h4 id="spirittroll">Spirit Troll</h4>
				<p>
					A troll blasted with psychic energy can take a nonphysical form when it regenerates. Its psyche survives, but the body of a spirit troll is as insubstantial as shadow. The troll might be unaware
					of the transition—it still moves and attacks with teeth and claws as it always did—but now it strikes at its victim's mind.
				</p>
				<h4 id="venomtroll">Venom Troll</h4>
				<p>
					A troll ravaged by massive doses of poison might mutate into a venom troll. Lingering poison infuses its blood and tissue, and poison leaks from its pores to coat its fangs and claws. These
					creatures are especially dangerous in close combat, because poison drips off their flesh and sprays out from every wound they receive.
				</p>
				<h4 id="loathsomelimbs">Loathsome Limbs Explanation</h4>
				<p>
					If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's
					initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait. A <b>severed leg</b> is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet. A
					<b>severed arm</b> has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. The <b>severed head</b>
					has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

				<summary>
					<h2>Unicorn</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Unicorns dwell in enchanted forests. Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight. A unicorn's brow
					sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the
					tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a
					unicorn's domain alive.<br>
					Good deities placed unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an enchanted forest. However, the gods
					sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they might send that
					individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures pursue at their peril. Unicorns most often serve deities of the forest and woodlands, including the gods of benevolent fey. Although all
					unicorns have natural healing power, some serve the gods in greater capacities, performing miracles normally reserved for high priests.<br>
					A unicorn's forest is a celestial realm where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled leaves escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears each breathy tune sung by the elves that reside
					amid the treetops. It senses where every caterpillar spins its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright butterfly rests its tired wings. In a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades.
					From wolves and foxes to birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, the creatures of a unicorn's domain seem quite tame. Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally mercurial fey loyally serve a
					unicorn when they dwell within its woods. Under a unicorn's protection, creatures feel safe from the threat of encroaching civilization and the insidious spread of evil. A unicorn roams its
					domain constantly, moving ever so carefully so as not to disturb other denizens. A creature might catch a passing glimpse of the unicorn then suddenly see nothing but the wild woods.<br>
					A unicorn's horn is the focus of its power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling ivory. Wands of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force.
					Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll ink, or use it as a component in eldritch rituals. However, any creature that takes a role, no matter how small, in slaying a
					unicorn is likely to become the target of divine retribution.<br>
					When darkness and evil threaten to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods' direct
					intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm. It is a holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and banish devils back to the Nine Hells. As long as the troubled times of darkness
					persist, the unicorn stays by the champion, its horn shining brightly to drive back the night. However, if the gods' champion falls from grace or turns from the cause of righteousness and good,
					the unicorn departs, never to return.
				</p>
				<p id="unicornlair">
					A unicorn's lair might be an ancient ruin overgrown with vines, a misty clearing surrounded by mighty oaks, a flower-covered hilltop alive with butterflies, or some other serene woodland
					location. Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.</li>
					<li>Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.</li>
					<li>When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points
						possible for the spell or effect.</li>
					<li>Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.

			<details id="vampire">
				<summary>
					<h2>Vampires</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never
					cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from
					its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion,
					vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with
					youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its
					transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places
					this way. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a
					spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire
					spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.</p>
				<p>Some vampires dabble in the arts of war or magic. Such vampires are Vampire Warriors or Wizards respectively.</p>
				<h4 id="vampirelair">A Vampire's Lair</h4>
				<p>
					A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn
					or other loyal creatures of the night. The region surrounding a vampire's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.</li>
					<li>Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.</li>
					<li>Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.</li>
					<li>A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days.</p>
				<h4>Ravnican Vampires</h4>
				<p>
					The vampires on the world of Ravnica differ from those usually found throughout the multiverse in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack
					the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence. Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where
					they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of
					experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Plenty of <b>Blood Drinker Vampires</b> haunt Ravnica's alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds. Consuming a creature's blood
						creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker to exert some magical influence over its victim.</li>
					<li>When vampires join House Dimir, they can learn to siphon mental energy and memories along with the blood of their victims. They also study the magic favored by Dimir mind mages, giving them a
						powerful combination of abilities ideal for espionage and infiltration, becoming <b>Mind Drinker Vampires</b>. The founder of House Dimir, Szadek, was the first of the mind drinkers. His
						secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from
						feeding on others of their kind. Thanks to their particular gifts. mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own agents,
						though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampi res might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to
						detect any hint of betrayal.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 id="nosferatu">Nosferatu</h4>
				<p>
					Vicious, undead hunters, nosferatu possess the endless thirst of vampires but none of their grace. For them, existence is nothing more than an everlasting string of cold, desperate nights
					punctuated by crimson splashes of momentary warmth and lucidity. These joys are fleeting, as their blood addiction can never be quelled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nosferatu feed on anything with blood. Heaps of mutilated rats and stables turned into slaughterhouses are typical first signs of a nosferatu's predation. When the sun interrupts their hunts,
					nosferatu retreat to favored ruins, sewers, or caves, caring nothing for their lair's comfort. Rather than retiring to crypts, they seek filthy or inaccessible fissures, places any living soul
					would avoid. For a few moments after feeding, nosferatu are lucid and capable of considering more than their next meal. In these instants, nosferatu recollect glimpses of what they once were,
					beings who knew pride, intention, and a world beyond the shadows. They might even momentarily be convinced to converse with other creatures. However, those who talk with nosferatu typically find
					them selfish, duplicitous creatures whose memories are faded and whose basic respect for life is long dead.

					<h2>Vampiric Mist</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					In billowing clouds of fog lurk vampiric mists, the wretched remnants of vampires that were prevented from finding rest. Indistinguishable from the mists they lurk within, they strike unseen and
					undetected to bleed their victims dry. Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who couldn't return to their burial places after being defeated or suffering
					some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampires' bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy,
					insatiable thirst for blood remains.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze through the creature's pores or spill out from
					its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can
					feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue that rains blood droplets wherever it goes. Like
					sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses
					its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.

			<details id="wight">
				<summary>
					<h2>Wight</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					The word "wight" meant "person" in days of yore, but the name now refers to evil undead who were once mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When death stills such a creature's heart and
					snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers
					the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda. Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of
					whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without
					distraction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark
					in all living things. When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places,
					surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast. Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven
					by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on
					their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.

					<h2>Wood Woad</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A wood woad is a powerful plant in humanoid form invested with the soul of someone who gave up life to become an eternal guardian. The ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed
					down through generations of savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the ritual isn't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain that requires it to be
					a willing sacrifice. In the ritual a living person's chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but
					often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. After three days, a
					sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a humanoid form. This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to
					perform its duty. The one who performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders unceasingly
				</p>
				<p>
					A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for
					supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that
					swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take adion, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Like a tree, a wood woad needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad
					guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another
					place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over. Wood woads are drawn to creatures that have close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants. Some
					treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the
					domain of a kindred guardian.

					<h2>Wyvern</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Travelers in the wild sometimes look to the skies to see the dark-winged shape of a wyvern carrying its prey. These cousins to the great dragons haunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their
					kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization. A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison
					stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to
					the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.<br>
					A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option. If forced into a
					confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.<br>
					A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature
					in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows. Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns
					lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to
					their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.<br>
					A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has
					cost the life of many a would-be master.

					A yellow musk creeper is an unholy vine whose flowers resemble an orchid's. Bright yellow with splashes of purple, these flowers expel a musk that attracts prey. A yellow musk creeper clings to
					walls, pillars, gravestones, door frames, or statuary in shadowy locations, remaining motionless until it strikes. A yellow musk creeper destroys the minds of humanoids, then implants bulbs in
					those it kills. Twenty-four hours after being implanted, a bulb sprouts a creeper vine that magically animates the host corpse, turning it into a yellow musk zombie under the young vine's
					control. In addition to protecting the defenseless plant, the zombie acts as fertilizer for the young creeper vine, which grows to full size in seven days. Once it is fully grown, the new yellow

					<h2>Yeti</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					A yeti's windborne howl sounds out across remote mountains, striking fear into the hearts of the scattered miners and herders that dwell there. These hulking creatures stalk alpine peaks in a
					ceaseless hunt for food. Their snow-white fur lets them move like ghosts against the frozen landscape. A yeti's icy simian eyes can freeze its prey in place.<br>
					Folk of the high peaks travel in groups and go armed, knowing that yetis can smell living flesh from miles away. When it finds prey, a yeti moves quickly over ice and stone to claim its meal,
					howling to the thrill of the hunt. Even in a blizzard, the scent of its quarry draws the yeti through the cold and snow. Yetis hunt in solitude or in small family groups. When creatures flee from
					a yeti or engage it in battle, other yetis might catch the scent of blood and close in. The territorial yetis fight one another for the spoils of such battles, and yetis slain in the fight are
					also eaten, amid euphoric howls.<br>
					Before an avalanche, a blizzard, or a deadly frost, the yetis' howls sweep down the mountain slopes on the icy wind. Some people of the alpine peaks believe that the voices of loved ones killed
					in avalanches and blizzards sound out in the wails of the yetis, crying warnings of ill omen. More pragmatic folk attest that the yeti's howl is a reminder that, despite the great accomplishments
					of civilization, the civilized become the hunted in nature's untamed domain.<br>
					When mountain herds are abundant, yetis stay clear of humanoid realms. Driven by hunger, they attack humanoid settlements in waves; breaking down gates and stockade walls that once might have
					daunted them, then devouring the creatures within. Devious mountain folk sometimes use the yetis as unwitting weapons. A warlord might lay down slaughtered sheep or goats to draw yetis into an
					enemy's camp, sowing chaos and thinning the ranks before battle. Mountain clan chiefs, wanting to expand their territory, overhunt local game to diminish the yetis' food supplies, inspiring
					attacks on humanoid settlements that are swiftly annexed in the aftermath.
					<b>Abominable Yeti:</b> An abominable yeti is larger than a normal yeti, standing three times as tall as a human. It typically lives and hunts alone, though a pair of abominable yetis might live
					together long enough to raise young. These towering yetis are highly territorial and savage, attacking and devouring any warm-blooded creatures they encounter, then scattering the bones across
					the ice and snow.<br>
					<b>Yeti Tyke:</b> Yeti tykes are seldom encountered. Adult yetis are very protective of their young, keeping them hidden from the rest of the world. A yeti tyke is between 1 and 7 years old. Yeti
					tykes are as volatile and mean as their parents, their fearsomeness diminished only by their size. Standing 3 feet tall on average, they like to bully creatures of their height or smaller. But
					they are easily intimidated by bigger and stronger creatures. A cowed yeti tyke can be controlled, at least for a while, but raising one to be anything other than a savage, flesh-eating predator
					is incredibly difficult.

					<h2>Yugoloths</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					Yugoloths are fickle fiends that inhabit the planes of Acheron, Gehenna, Hades, and Carceri. They act as mercenaries and are notorious for their shifting loyalties. They are the embodiments of
					avarice. Before serving under anyone's banner, a yugoloth asks the only question on its mind: <i>What's in it for me?</i><br>
					Summoned yugoloths demand much for their time and loyalty. Whatever promises a yugoloth makes are quickly broken when a better opportunity presents itself. Unlike demons, yugoloths can be
					reasoned with, but unlike devils, they are rarely true to their word. Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any
					warlord on the Material Plane can pay. Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far
					less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits
					them to do so. When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be destroyed
					permanently. A yugoloth knows this and acts accordingly. When summoned to other planes, a yugoloth fights without concern for its own well-being. On Gehenna, it is more apt to retreat or plead
					for mercy if its demise seems imminent. When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name vanishes from every <i class="artimagit">Book of Keeping</i>. If a yugoloth is re-created by way of an
					unholy ritual requiring the expenditure of souls, its name reappears in the books.
				</p>
				<h4>The Books of Keeping</h4>
				<p>
					The first yugoloths were created by a sisterhood of night hags on Gehenna. It is widely believed that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating an army of
					fiends that were not bound to the Nine Hells. In the course of making this new army, the hags crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the
					General of Gehenna. These tomes were called the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i>. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the 
					yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is rumored that the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i> contain the true names
					of a few demon lords and archdevils as well. Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the ensuing power grab, the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i>
					were lost or stolen. When all four copies of the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i> disappeared, Asmodeus and the night hags lost control of their yugoloth creations. Each
					<i class="artimagit">Book of Keeping</i> still exists, drifting from plane to plane, where the brave.and the foolish occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, as
					inscribed in the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i>, is forced to serve its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making its
					displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will follow its instructions to the letter while looking for opportunities to misinterpret them.
				</p>
				<h4 id="arcanaloth">Arcanaloth</h4>
				<p>
					Arcanaloths are sly, jackal-headed beings with humanoid bodies, but they can employ magic to take any humanoid form. They do so to gain the trust of creatures with whom they negotiate, replacing
					jackal snarls with winsome smiles. Regardless of its chosen form, an arcanaloth appears well groomed, clothing itself in fine robes. Highly intelligent spellcasters who hunger for knowledge and 
					power, arcanaloths command units of lesser yugoloths and maintain the contracts, records, and accounts of their kind. Arcanaloths speak and write all languages, making them cunning diplomats and
					negotiators. An arcanaloth properly paid can broker treaties or alliances with subtlety and finesse, just as an arcanaloth who changes sides can easily turn the best-laid peace talks into
					all-out war. What the fiend demands in exchange for its time and talent is information, as well as powerful magic items that it can trade for even more information. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="canoloth">Canoloth</h4>
				<p>
					Canoloths prefer to enter into contracts to guard valuable treasures and important locations. They always do exactly as asked—never any more, never any less. With senses sharp enough to pinpoint
					the locations of nearby invisible creatures, canoloths respond unfailingly to any threat to their charges. Furthermore, they emit a magical distortion field that prevents creatures close to them
					from teleporting. Canoloths confront intruders with swift and terrible force, projecting long, spiny tongues to grab their foes and drag them close. What happens next depends on the contract.
					Unless instructed to kill, a canoloth merely holds onto its prisoner, but if given the order to do so, it tears its prey limb from limb.
				</p>
				<h4 id="dhergoloth">Dhergoloth</h4>
				<p>
					Dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with five sets of claws, which extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take contracts to put down uprisings,
					clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their unhinged laughter rising above their victims' screams. Since dhergoloths are little more
					than dumb brutes, employers must use caution when instructing these fiends. They can handle simple orders that don't take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, they either
					forget what they're told or don't listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="hydroloth">Hydroloth</h4>
				<p>
					Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away their thoughts for delivery to whatever master they happen
					to serve. Hydroloths are skilled at finding lost things, especially those that have been swallowed up in the deeps. For amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, hydroloths have no equal
					among yugoloths. They sometimes hire themselves out to attack and scuttle ships and raid coastal settlements. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="merrenoloth">Merrenoloth</h4>
				<p>
					The grim, gaunt captains of the ferries on the River Styx, merrenoloths have total command of their vessels, ensuring that their passengers reach their destinations safely. Sometimes
					merrenoloths can be coaxed away from the Lower Planes to captain other vessels, affording those ships and crews the same protection. Whenever a merrenoloth takes on a contract to captain a ship,
					it bonds with the vehicle to make sure nothing goes awry with it during the journey. A merrenoloth can navigate its ship safely through the worst storms, always stays on course, and never runs
					afoul of the myriad hazards that can thwart lesser captains. A merrenoloth can hold its own in a fight, but it prefers to avoid combat when possible. In fact, it typically specifies in its
					contracts that it is under no obligation to fight. A merrenoloth's first duty is always to its vessel.
				</p>
				<h4 id="mezzoloth">Mezzoloth</h4>
				<p>
					The bulk of the yugoloth population is made up of mezzoloths, which are human-sized insect creatures covered in dense chitinous plates. Mezzoloths serve as foot soldiers in yugoloth armies,
					their wide-set eyes glowing red as the mezzoloths bear down on their foes. Violence and reward are the fundamental drives of a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise one or the other can
					easily attract them into service. Although it has lethal claws on its four arms, a mezzoloth typically wields a trident in two of them. If surrounded by enemies, a mezzoloth exhales toxic fume
					that can choke and kill whole groups of creatures. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="nycaloth">Nycaloth</h4>
				<p>
					The elite airborne shock troops of the yugoloths, nycaloths look like muscular gargoyles. Powerful bat wings bear them swiftly aloft in battle, and the razor-sharp claws of their hands and feet
					cut through flesh and bone with ease. A nightmarish foe, a nycaloth strikes hard and fast without warning, then teleports away. It uses its innate magic to turn invisible or create illusory
					doubles of itself, further confounding its enemies. Nycaloths are the most loyal of the yugoloths. When they find an evil master that treats them well, they are unlikely to break their agreement
					unless the reward for doing so is extreme. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="oinoloth">Oinoloth</h4>
				<p>
					Grim specters of death, oinoloths bring pestilence wherever they go. To armies who recognize their awful forms, their mere appearance causes soldiers to break ranks and flee, lest they succumb
					to one of the awful plagues that oinoloths let loose. Oinoloths provide the ultimate solution to thorny problems, usually by killing everyone involved. They are hired as a last resort, when a
					siege has gone on too long or an army has proved too strong to overcome. Once summoned, oinoloths stalk the killing field, poisoning the ground and sickening creatures they encounter. Sometimes
					they might be hired to lift the very plagues they spread, but the price for such work is high, and the effort turns the creatures they save into debilitated wrecks.
				</p>
				<h4 id="ultroloth">Ultroloth</h4>
				<p>
					Ultroloths command the yugoloth armies of the Blood War. An ultroloth looks like a slender gray-skinned humanoid with an elongated head. Its face bears no features except for two ovoid eyes.
					These eyes can become sparkling pools of light that can transfix other creatures and leave them reeling and helpless. Frequently at one another's throats, ultroloths continually scheme to
					enhance their own power. When not employed to fight in the Blood War, ultroloths lead yugoloth forces throughout the planes, acting as crime bosses or commanders of evil mercenary companies. With
					a reputation for cruelty, ultroloths command their minions to fight while the ultroloths stay removed from combat themselves. Lesser yugoloths know their place when facing an ultroloth and
					respond to its summons without demand for payment.<br>
					Somewhere in the brimstone wastes of Gehenna, there roams an ultroloth so strong that none contests his power: the General of Gehenna. Many yugoloths search for this great general in the hope of
					serving with him. They believe that service with the General of Gehenna grants power and prestige among lower planar entities. Whatever the case, no fiend finds the General unless the General
					desires it. His personal name is unknown, and even the <i class="artimagit">Books of Keeping</i> contain no mention of this powerful, thoroughly evil entity. 
				</p>
				<h4 id="yagnoloth">Yagnoloth</h4>
				<p>
					Anyone who would contract yugoloths for a task usually ends up dealing with a yagnoloth. Cunning negotiators, these strange fiends handle the writing of contracts for all of their kind. Once a
					yagnoloth is hired, it communicates its employer's desires to the fiends it commands. Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from 
					<b>arcanaloths</b> and <b>ultroloths</b>. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the fiends under their command. A yagnoloth follows the
					dictates in a contract it negotiated, but it is certain to have included a loophole to escape its obligation if the situation warrants. A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized
					arm, and it always covers one or the other with a long cape. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uncovers its human arm and uses it to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary
					or when combat is joined, it shifts its cape to reveal its brutally powerful giant appendage.

				<summary>
					<h2>Zombie</h2>
				</summary>
				<p>
					From somewhere in the darkness, a gurgling moan is heard. A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too
					slow to escape its grasp. Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a
					jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br>
					Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a
					zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a <i>Resurrection</i>
					spell. A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that
					it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br>
					Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a
					battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise
					from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br>
					Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore,
					clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of
					acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation. A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in
					whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the undead, a lone zombie ranks far from the most menacing. The horror of the shambling dead lies not in their individual menace, though, but their numbers, their persistence, and their
					disregard for their own well-being. A throng of zombies will douse a forest fire with their own ashes or march into a dragon's maw until the monster chokes. In the course of their relentless
					marches, zombies might suffer all manner of trauma, potentially reducing them to masses of crawling limbs (<b>swarm of zombie limbs</b>), infecting them with terrible diseases (</b>zombie plague
					spreader</b>), or crushing an entire horde into a single, rotting titan (<b>zombie clot</b>)

				<h4><i>Becoming a Brambleheart</i></h4>
				<p> Any humanoid can become a brambleheart if it is subjected to the appropriate ritual by another creature that knows it. The prospecting brambleheart is usually a willing subject, whether they were
					mislead or not, but as long as the subject can be kept still for the appropriate amount of time, the ritual works just as well on an unwilling creature. Apply the changes listed below to make a
					brambleheart out of a given NPC template.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ritual to become a brambleheart takes 3 full days. The second day of the ritual involves cutting out the heart of the subject, and if the ritual is interrupted after this, the subject dies. A
					finished ritual bestows the following benefits upon a creature:
				</p>
				<p>
					Increase the subject's Strength score by 2. If the subject would gain the Ability Score Improvement feature, the highest possible score it can increase its strength to is 22.<br>
					The subject is immune to being charmed and has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>A Brambleheart is a humanoid, who has had their heart replaced with a ball of vines and brambles by way of a ritual. This new heart bestows the brambleheart with enhanced physical abilities, but also
				with a fanatical loyalty to the source of the new heart, usually a powerful fey creature or a god of plants or the wilderness. The personality of a brambleheart remains otherwise unchanged, and a
				small scattering of bramblehearts survive the death of their master, leaving them to roam the world as they see fit.</p>
			<h4 id="rosedragon">Rose dragon</h4>
			<p>Rose dragons are dragons corrupted and warped by the Rose Queen. They are fanatically loyal to their queen, and their breath is infused with fey magic.</p>
			<h2 id="rosecourtesan">Rose Courtesans</h2>
			<p>Rose Courtesans are women, usually elves, who were selected by the Rose Queen to serve her directly. They follow any command issued by their queen without question, and work, body and soul to fulfill
				them. A courtesan's ultimate goal is the position of handmaiden, a personal attendant to the queen herself and in command of legions of converted creatures. Every courtesan chases after this position
				in her own way, but it is mostly a matter of unfailingly fulfilling her own role and making sure to hinder the advancement or orchestrate the downfall of others of her kind.
